"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 14:21:37 -0400",US Indices Are At Support: Will Price Bounce Or Break Through?,"I have mentioned in my previous posts that being in tune with the seasonal movement of the market is essential as an investor. This has two main benefits: Understanding when trends are likely, offering entry points and a time to act and build a portfolio. It's about knowing when pullbacks are likely and being aware of when to stand aside and potentially look to buy in at pullbacks from solid support levels. January/February and September are synonymous with pullbacks. This year has already delivered on that front. Whereas most will be panicking based on the noise in their media channels, good investors will remain objective, focus on the charts and already have a contingency plan in place that they are now executing. My bias overall still remains bullish. Let's have a look at the daily chart of each of the three major indices to understand why. See Also: Superbubble? Legendary Market Pundit Says Stocks Could Fall By Nearly 50% The S&P 500 The price continues to trade above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Today's price action has seen the price drop further but it has bounced intraday as expected with this major moving average also doubling up as a key level of support in a bull trend. As long as the price remains above the daily 200 SMA, my bias remains bullish. The Nasdaq 100 The price is currently trading just below the daily 200 SMA. The Dow Jones 30 Like the Nasdaq 100, the price is also trading just below the daily 200 SMA. Do note that the S&P 500 is my primary indicator of market conditions. If it holds at the daily 200 SMA, as it is currently doing, then I expect the Nasdaq 100 and the Dow 30 to move back up their respective daily 200 SMA. How does this translate to individual stocks? Stocks that have been trending well for a number of months will be the ones that see the deepest declines. HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a good example. The price moved 320% from the breakout in June 2020 to the high of November 2021. The correction from the high is 45%. Below is the monthly timeframe. Some stocks that have not been trending for any significant period of time will go into consolidation. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a good example, with the price moving sideways since mid-December. It's now also trading around the daily 50 SMA, which has the potential to act as support and push the price up. Below is the daily timeframe. A handful of stocks will continue to trend, forming pullbacks in the trend. Berkshire Hathaway (NASDAQ: BRK-B) is a good example, a stock I covered in a previous post. The first potential level of support is the daily 20 SMA. Below is the daily timeframe. As already mentioned, my stance remains bullish, and I monitor each stock individually. If the indices form a bear trend continuation below their daily 200 SMA, then my bias will change from bullish to bearish and when I will look to short the market as I did in 2008. For now, the price action is in a pullback until the structure of the trend dictates otherwise.","US Indices Are At Support: Will Price Bounce Or Break Through?.

If it holds at the daily 200 SMA, as it is currently doing, then I expect the Nasdaq 100 and the Dow 30 to move back up their respective daily 200 SMA. How does this translate to individual stocks? Stocks that have been trending well for a number of months will be the ones that see the deepest declines. HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a good example. The price moved 320% from the breakout in June 2020 to the high of November 2021. The correction from the high is 45%. Below is the monthly timeframe. Some stocks that have not been trending for any significant period of time will go into consolidation. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a good example, with the price moving sideways since mid-December. It's now also trading around the daily 50 SMA, which has the potential to act as support and push the price up. Below is the daily timeframe. A handful of stocks will continue to trend, forming pullbacks in the trend. Berkshire Hathaway (NASDAQ: BRK-B) is a good example, a stock I covered in a previous post. The first potential level of support is the daily 20 SMA. Below is the daily timeframe. As already mentioned, my stance remains bullish, and I monitor each stock individually. If the indices form a bear trend continuation below their daily 200 SMA, then my bias will change from bullish to bearish and when I will look to short the market as I did in 2008. For now, the price action is in a pullback until the structure of the trend dictates otherwise.",,

So, if option traders are at large bearish, that could have a negative impact on equity prices. See Also: Why The SPY Must Hold This Key Level To Avoid Disaster What Else? Another technical indicator that was pointed out on Friday, was the 200-day moving average of the S&P 500.

S&P 500 TRADES BELOW 200-DAY MOVING AVG FOR FIRST TIME SINCE JUNE 29, 2020 — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 21, 2022 A stock dipping below its 200-day moving average is a very bearish sign for most technical traders. The 200-day moving average tracks the average price of a stock throughout the last 200 trading days. Once a stock dips below that moving average, it's a sign of weakness and oftentimes a sign that the stock has even further to drop. Of course, this doesn't mean that the indicators will always be bearish for the S&P 500. Instead, the moving average is showing a trend, and once that trend reverses, look for the S&P to come back to its 200-day moving average, and even break through it when we are back in more bullish times.

The SPY Chart: After hitting a low of $420.76 at 12;15 p.m. EST on Monday the SPY began to bounce up from that level as bulls bought the dip. A much larger bounce may eventually come because the SPY’s relative strength index is at about 20%.

Eventually the ETF will have to bounce up to continue in the downward pattern. Traders can watch for the SPY to bounce up to the 200-day SMA and whether or not the ETF can regain the level will determine the subsequent direction. If the SPY is unable to regain the level it may fall down to backtest the important psychological level at $400.

This content is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investing advice. A wealth of investment vehicles have been configured in the image of one of the stock market’s most common sayings – “don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Investors have often used standard exchange-traded funds (ETF) like the SPDR S&P 500 (NASDAQ:SPY), Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) to heed this advice and make bets on the direction of the market (or a large portion of it). The use of options to trade these ETFs has also exploded in recent years. Despite their popularity, however, ETF options come with byproducts that can make it difficult to consistently profit or successfully hedge against existing positions. As a close cousin to the ETF option, a cash settled index option may provide investors benefits without as many risks. Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) is taking this concept one step further: With the Mini-S&P 500 Index (XSPSM) and Mini-Russell 2000 (MRUTSM) Index, it is providing investors with access to these instruments – and all their benefits – at 1/10th the size of standard contracts - providing greater accessibility based on your portfolio size. What Benefits? 1. European Options and Cash Settlements Equity options – including ETF options – can be exercised at any time. This feature presents both buyers and sellers with potential complications. Consider the call seller whose position is deep in the money for 2 minutes and deep out of the money for the remaining duration of the options contract. Because of the exercise-at-any-time rule, this seller may still lose money if the buyer exercised their right to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price when the position was deep in the money. Now consider the investor who buys a call option with a week’s expiration – then goes on holiday for two weeks. Suppose during that time, the contract was exercised and they were granted the 100 shares of stock at a profit, but unexpected news caused the stock price to drop significantly below the initial entry before returning from the holiday. This buyer would have appropriately captured profit from the options contract but lost anyway because equity options are settled in stock rather than cash. When trading Mini-SPX options, there’s no threat of early exercise and no position uncertainty. These options are settled in cash (not shares), so there’s no need to square up positions after expiration. Plus, Mini-SPX options are so-called “European options,” which means they can only be exercised at expiration. 2. Tax Efficiency According to Section 1256 of the tax code, those who choose to trade index options may qualify for 60% long-term, 40% short-term capital gains tax treatment given that certain conditions are met. Because of the nature of index options, they settle to cash instead of shares, and investors cannot exercise them before expiration. ETF options are not part of this tax benefit. 3. Dividend Risk Avoidance Option sellers hold the obligation to deliver not only the 100 shares of stock at the strike price but also the dividend incurred during the holding period – if the buyer chooses to exercise their right. The option seller, thus, has to fork over both stock and cash to the buyer, and this requirement is true for both naked and covered options. For option sellers, there’s no escaping these obligations with ETF options, but there is an escape with Mini Index options. While dividends are often relatively small, because indices do not pay dividends, Mini Index option sellers don’t need to worry about dividend risk. 4. Affordability The final, and most obvious, benefit to using Cboe’s Mini Index options is their extreme affordability, which makes them far more accessible to retail traders.

SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) YTD Return: -4.6% 52-Week Range: $379.37 to $479.98 Price: $453.92 The S&P 500 themed ETF was the most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro for the month of January. The ETF was the eighth most searched ticker in 2021 across Benzinga Pro. The ETF and S&P 500 Index serves as gauges for overall market strength and news, which could lead to an increase in searches for the ticker to find macros news and themes. 2. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) YTD Return: -11.9% 52-Week Range: $539.49 to $1243.49 Price: $889.49 The most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in all of 2021 comes in second place to start 2022. The electric vehicle giant had nearly as many searches as SPY in January, but came up just short. Tesla reported quarterly earnings in January, which likely helped with continued interest in the stock. 3. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) YTD Return: -1.7% 52-Week Range: $116.21 to $182.94 Price: $174.23 Technology giant Apple was the third most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in January but had a wide gap from TSLA and SPY, with SPY searches nearly double that of AAPL. Like Tesla, Apple reported quarterly earnings in the month of January, which likely led to increased interest. AAPL was the second most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in 2021. 4. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) YTD Return: -8.2% 52-Week Range: $224.26 to $349.67 Price: $310.87 Microsoft was the fourth most searched ticker in January, a month that saw the company report quarterly earnings.

The stock has been mentioned as a short squeeze candidate with high short interest and a high borrow cost on shares. The stock did not rank in the top 20 most searched tickers for 2021. 6.

The company updated investors on its plans to continue expanding in the electric vehicle sector. The stock was a strong performer over the last two years and sees strong interest from investors. 7. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) YTD Return: -16.2% 52-Week Range: $115.66 to $346.47 Price: $244.88 Semiconductor company NVIDIA has been a strong performer, with shares up over 80% in the last year.

Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) YTD Return: -21.3% 52-Week Range: $16.12 to $57.75 Price: $26.82 Electric vehicle company Lucid continues to see strong interest from investors and was a top 10 searched ticker in January.

Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) YTD Return: -8.1% 52-Week Range: $297.45 to $408.71 Price: $361.80 The second ETF to rank in the top 10 is the QQQ, which tracks the top stocks in the Nasdaq. Given the wide interest in technology related and growth stocks, it isn’t too big of a surprise that it was one of the most searched tickers. Earnings reports from top components also likely contributed. 10. Digital World Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ:DWAC) YTD Return: +61.9% 52-Week Range: $9.84 to $175.00 Price: $76.39 The SPAC taking Donald Trump’s media group public continues to be one of the most searched tickers. While DWAC didn’t rank in the top 10 for 2021, it did place high in the second half of the year after the deal was announced.

This content is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investing advice. The equities market had yet another gangbuster year in 2021. Despite a pandemic, rising inflation, and political tensions, the SPDR S&P 500 trust (NYSE:SPY) would reward 2019 investors with a stellar 72% return in the three years leading up to 2021. Other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) encompassing different sectors and securities like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) share three successive years of positive returns, albeit of differing magnitudes. For those up to date on the stock market’s activity, these picks are likely unsurprising, as many contenders in these industries saw immense growth in 2021. Metaverse-intensive Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), for example, grew 125% in 2021, and newcomer Roblox Corp. (NASDAQ:RBLX) grew by 60% during the same year as its initial public offering. In a similar vein, electric-vehicle companies like Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) and XPeng Inc. (NASDAQ:XPEV) received significant interest in 2021, and the former saw a yearly gain of 280%. With the Consumer Price Index rising by roughly 7% in 2021 – the highest reading since 1982 – some investors are increasingly wary that this movement is unsustainable, particularly in growth stocks. Analyst firms and professional funds seem to have reached a consensus that 2022 could be a rockier year for the equities market, prompting a portion of investors to look elsewhere for potential opportunities. FOREX.com: A Potential Avenue Into Foreign Exchange Trading? For many investors, the sturdy foreign exchange market might provide a potential outlet for opportunities in 2022. If 2021 was any indication, there are plenty of opportunities for investors in the foreign exchange (forex) market. Take the pound-to-dollar (GBP/USD) pair. Between January 4 and February 24, the pair had risen from 1.357 to 1.414, exhibiting a 5% bullish run with little pauses in between. After a slight decline and a double top around June, the pair began a 7.48% descent that took it from a high of 1.424 to a low of 1.316 on December 8th. The currency climbed to a high of 1.374 on Jan.13 2022, another 4.44% move in just a month. The volatile movements presented both bulls and bears – and traders who alternate in between – a variety of tasty opportunities in 2021, and it looks like 2022 is set for similarly rocky price action. The euro-to-dollar (EUR/USD) presented another terrain of opportunities for traders with a keen eye for trends, reversals and breakouts. Unlike the GBP/USD pair, the EUR/USD began in 2020 in weakness, dropping from a high of 1.235 on Jan. 6 to a low of 1.17 on March 31. The 5.17% slump then turned around swifty, sending the pair back up to 1.226 by May 26. The pair then experienced a 7.83% fall that took the pair to a low of 1.130 on December 31st. As the equities market cools down, FOREX.com is one example of a platform that may provide investors with a reliable avenue to trade volatility in other markets.

Zeynep Elif Özdemir/Pexels A Missing Piece Falls Into Place One of the objections to claims that Russia would invade Ukraine earlier this week was the lack of a casus belli for the Russian people. Clint Ehrlich made this point on Twitter, And Russian journalist Anatoly Karlin made a similar point in his piece we presented yesterday (""Why Russia May Invade Ukraine After All""): One of the main counter-arguments is that Russia has invested scant resources into war propaganda. The obvious rejoinder is that any casus belli - be it a false flag, or kindly provisioned by the Ukrainians themselves - will only appear towards the tail end of prewar preparations, and that a propaganda campaign preceding it would only serve to discredit it. Now we appear to have that casus belli, as Karlin noted on Twitter early Thursday: Bear in mind that whether this report by Russian state media is accurate or not is beside the point; the point is that the Russian people would need to hear a reason why their armed forces are invading Ukraine, and this could serve as such a reason. Investment Considerations The likely market reaction to an all-out invasion of Ukraine by Russia would be probably be to the downside. For that reason, as we suggested yesterday, you might want to consider hedging by purchasing optimal put options on a broad based index ETF such as the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (NYSE:SPY) or the Invesco QQQ ETF (NYSE:QQQ).

This content is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investing advice. Could a growth slump be on its way to the equities market? With the consumer price index rising by roughly 7% in 2021 – the highest reading since 1982 – and the Federal Reserve’s decision to tighten credit faster and execute three interest rate hikes in 2022, many professionals believe that the time has come for equities to slow down. Shon Anderson, president and chief wealth strategist for Anderson Financial Strategies, for example, has hinted that 2022 may be a lackluster year in the stock market and portfolios in general, while other analyst groups like Schaeffer Investment Research have drawn similar conclusions. While no one – not even professionals – has a crystal ball, it seems safe to assume that monumental moves exhibited by growth stocks like Roblox Corp. (NASDAQ:RBLX) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) may not be as frequent in 2022. With growth stocks possibly diminishing and professionals hinting at a difficult terrain, investors are likely considering other avenues for opportunities. FOREX.com believes that its metal offerings may provide just what they’re looking for. Metals with FOREX.com FOREX.com – the U.S.’s leading broker for forex trading according to the monthly Retail Forex Obligations Reports published by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission – grants investors several avenues to engage with metals. The broker provides access to unleveraged spot gold and spot silver against the US Dollar. The former commodity may prove an interesting avenue in 2022 with several reports hinting at the possibility for bullish sentiment for gold in 2022. For one, with the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate hikes, the finding that gold has averaged a 200% appreciation within the last 5 rate-hike cycles has placed it on some investors’ radars. Rising demand for gold jewelry and scarcity in gold reserves serve as other potential fundamental catalysts, and an examination of the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) provides further ammunition for optimistic bulls. The chart showcases a textbook cup and handle pattern that’s indicative of a possible continuation to the upside. FOREX.com offers Spot Gold and Spot Silver against the U.S. dollar, providing plenty of opportunities for the American investing audience to engage in predictions for 2022. As the SPDR S&P 500 (NASDAQ:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) experience their much-anticipated corrections, some may say that the time is ripe for alternative investments.

"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 15:46:14 -0400",A Look At Some Investment Considerations Amid Russian Invasion,"Russia Invades Ukraine A couple of weeks ago, we shared Russian journalist Anatoly Karlin's prediction of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, and suggested readers hedge in light of it tracking ETFs such as the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (NYSE:SPY) or the Invesco QQQ ETF (NYSE:QQQ). Hopefully, some of you took that opportunity to hedge. As we write this, the invasion is happening, and as Anatoly Karlin predicted, Russia has decided to go big. Since Germany had already canceled the Nord Stream 2 pipeline system, which is majority owned by Russian energy company Gazprom (OTC:OGZPY), and Russia was going to be subjected to sanctions for its Ukraine incursion anyway, it had little to lose. As of early morning Ukraine time, airports across the country had been struck. The tweeter above, Julia Skripka-Serry, is a Ukrainian pharmaceutical securities analyst and investor we've corresponded with for years. Footage of the airport pictured above being struck by a Russian cruise missile is in the tweet below. Russia struck Ukrainian seaports too. As Mark Ames noted, Russia hit every port and airfield mentioned in Putin's speech Monday as having been refurbished for NATO use. At least one Ukrainian Air Force plane hightailed it for Romania rather than facing the Russians. Apparently, that Ukrainian pilot wasn't the only one trying to get out of dodge. Russian troops from Belarus invaded Ukraine from the north. This is consistent with Putin's argument last year that Belarussians, Ukrainians, and Russians ought to be essentially one nation, as Anatoly Karlin wrote in the piece of his we shared here recently: The capstone to the Nationalist Turn was laid by Putin in his seminal July 2021 article “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians“, in which affirmed that the Ukrainians are a colorful and distinct, but nonetheless inseparable, part of the All-Russian nation, drew a straight line between Ukraine as a de facto colony of Germany following Russia’s exit from World War I and its relation to the West today, repeated his long-standing view that the Bolsheviks laid a time bomb by including the right of secession in the 1924 USSR Constitution, and noted the coercive nature of “Ukrainization” as an ideological project aimed against “so-called” Great Russian chauvinism, thus securing at the state level “three separate Slavic Peoples” – the Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians – as opposed to the “large Russian nation, a triune people comprising Great Russians, Malorossiyans, and Belorussians.” The Fog Of War As always in war, early information sometimes proves to have been false, so we've tried to be judicious with what we've shared here. There's still much we don't know. For example, what's the current status of the so-called ""Babushka Battalion""? What has happened to the ""lethal aid"" sent to Ukraine by the U.S. in recent weeks remains a mystery as well. The best we can hope for at this point is that this war ends quickly, with minimal casualties, and none of the weapons we sent there end up in terrorists' or criminals' hands. Investment Considerations As we wrote last week, the likely implications of a Russian invasion were stocks heading down, with the possible exception of some commodity names. From that post: The likely market reaction to an all-out invasion of Ukraine by Russia would be probably be to the downside. For that reason, as we suggested yesterday, you might want to consider hedging by purchasing optimal put options on a broad based index ETF such as the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) or the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ). One sector that may rally in the event of an invasion is oil. Our current top oil name is the Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull 2X Shares ETF (NYSE:GUSH). We'll see how GUSH does on Thursday. There will likely be some bargains in other sectors in the wake of the current war in Ukraine.

Stock markets opened lowered Thursday but staged a late comeback that put the day in select company in terms of range of movement. What Happened: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) opened Thursday at $411.02. Shares of the ETF traded between $410.64 and $428.76 on the day, with a closing price of $428.30.

The U.S. military conflict after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 led to a decline in the S&P 500. The index declined 7.4% from Sept. 10, 2001 to Sept. 10, 2003. The S&P 500 gained 29.1% during the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War (March 1965 to March 1973). The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 50% during World War II (Sept. 1, 1939 to Aug. 31, 1945).

Here is a look at the stocks that were searched for most on Benzinga Pro for the month of February. 1. SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) YTD Return: -8.1% 52-Week Range: $371.88 to $479.88 Price: $436.63 For the second straight month, the S&P 500 ETF was the most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro. The ETF was the eighth most-searched ticker in 2021 across Benzinga Pro.

"Sat, 05 Mar 2022 18:11:56 -0400",Here's How Much You'd Have Right Now If You Invested $100 In Tesla When Elon Musk Was Sued By The SEC In 2018,"Investors who placed their hard-earned cash into major US indices have enjoyed respectable returns since fall 2018. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NASDAQ:SPY), Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NASDAQ:DIA) have returned 48.65%, 81.55% and 27.26% respectively. As good as investors in the major US indices have had it since 2018, investors in the broader electric vehicle (EV) space have had it that much better. Bulls that took a chance on Tesla following the fall 2018 announcement of the SEC suing the EV-giant’s CEO Elon Musk for securities fraud, and held through the time of publication, have cashed in big time. For the uninitiated, Tesla investors back in 2018 experienced a very unorthodox announcement on Aug. 7, when Musk tweeted that he was considering taking the company private, with “funding secured.” According to the SEC filing, the misleading statements made by the Tesla chief falsely indicated it was certain that he could, in fact, take Tesla private at a specified purchase price. This purchase price reflected a premium over the price of Tesla shares at the time.

Thankfully, there are ways we can track sentiment and find clues about when markets may reverse. It's no secret that as traders we love having information and being able to objectively measure market behavior. So in 1993, Robert Whaley, a professor at Vanderbilt, created an index to track fear and uncertainty: the VIX. The VIX (CBOE: VIX) is a measure of volatility: it tracks the movements of options contracts of the S&P 500 Index (NYSE:SPY). In times of uncertainty, the VIX rises. So Why Is The VIX Important? Ryan Detrick, chief marketing strategist at LPL Financial Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LPLA), tweeted an interesting fact about how the market performs following times of high uncertainty. The VIX closed beneath 30 after 11 consecutive days above this level. This could be a good sign, as when previous streaks ended it brought some solid returns.

"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 11:41:13 -0400",Market Rises Despite Increasing Tensions Between The U.S. And Russia And Spiking Food And Energy Costs: Time To Take Advantage Of The Bounce To Hedge.,"War damage in Kiev (Алесь Усцінаў/Pexels). Market Bounces Despite Increasing Risks Last week was the second week in a row that the S&P 500 traded higher. The market has now regained all of its losses from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it's not clear that the risk environment is better. On the contrary, geopolitical and economic risks seem to have increased over the last month. The biggest risk remains the war between Russia and Ukraine escalating to one between NATO and Russia. On that score, we've had some concerning news in recent days. Most recently, President Biden called for Russian President Putin's removal, before a White House staffer attempted to walk it back. This sort of gaffe might have been less concerning if diplomatic channels between the U.S. and Russia were open, but apparently U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken hasn't spoken with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, since before the war started. High level military channels don't seem to be open either: the Washington Post reported last week that calls by the U.S. Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have gone unanswered by their Russian counterparts. Another danger is that geopolitical and economic risks can feed into each other. We've seen food and energy costs spike in the wake of the war in Ukraine and sanctions in response to it, and as ZeroHedge noted citing the Statista chart graphic below, there's a historical correlation between high food prices and political instability. In short, the market has bounced in spite of these risks over the last two weeks; as the Market Ear pointed out on Friday, this may be a good time to hedge. Here's a relatively cheap way to protect your portfolio now. Setting Initial Conditions For the purposes of this example, we'll assume your portfolio is worth $500,000, and that it’s closely correlated with the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSE:SPY). We'll also assume you have enough diversification within it to protect against stock-specific risk, and that you can tolerate a decline of up to 20%. If you have a smaller risk tolerance, you can use the same approach entering a smaller decline threshold, Similarly, if you have a larger or smaller portfolio, you can adjust Step 1 below accordingly. If you have gold, bonds, or other asset classes in your portfolio, we'll address that at the end. Hedging Stock Market Risk Step 1 Divide the dollar value of your portfolio by the current price of SPY. For this example, we'll use numbers as of Friday's close, but obviously, you'll use current data when you do it. SPY closed at $452.29 on Friday. Dividing $500,000 by $452.29 gets you 1,105 shares (rounded up). Step 2 Scan for the optimal, or least expensive, puts to protect against a >20% decline in your number of shares of SPY at the options expiration you want. We've selected the June 30th expiration below. It's far enough out to give you some breathing room, and it's not too expensive. This and the next screen capture are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app, but our website scans for optimal hedges too. As you can see above, the number of options contracts the algorithm presented was 11. Since each options contract covers 100 shares, what our algorithm does when you enter a number containing an odd lot like 1,105 is this: it slightly over-hedges the round lots (the 1,100 shares, in this case), so that your entire position, including those extra 5 shares, is protected against the drawdown you specified. Note the cost here: $3,564, or 0.71% of portfolio value. The app calculated that conservatively, using the ask price of the puts (in practice, you can often buy options at some price between the bid and ask prices). Step 3 Round up the number of SPY shares to the nearest 100 and repeat step 2. Note that, in this case, it was cheaper to hedge 1,105 shares using the first hedge, so you would go with that. Hedging Other Asset Classes In our simplified example above, your portfolio was 100% stocks that were highly correlated with SPY. Let's say your portfolio includes a broader range of asset classes: 40% diversified stocks, 20% tech stocks, 40% bonds. You could use the same approach as above using the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) as the ticker for the tech stocks, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) or the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund ETF (NYSE:LQD) for the bonds (depending if they're Treasuries or corporates). So, in that case, you'd divide the dollar amount of your tech stocks by the current price of QQQ, etc.","Market Rises Despite Increasing Tensions Between The U.S. And Russia And Spiking Food And Energy Costs: Time To Take Advantage Of The Bounce To Hedge..

What Happened: The order cuts implemented by most consumer electronics brands have only taken into account the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war on the demand from these nations, famed Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) analyst Ming-Chi Kuo warned on Thursday. Kuo's comments came in the form of a tweet in Chinese, which he also made available in an English translation on Medium. Not referring to any particular company, Kuo, an analyst at TFI Securities, said these brands haven't taken into account or are unwilling to admit, that there could be a more severe impact from other factors as well. The analyst noted that a dent in consumer confidence, a rise in global inflationary pressure, the impact of the Ukraine war on the European economy and the COVID-19 lockdown in China due to the renewed outbreak of the pandemic will likely impact the demand outlook. Non-accounting of impact from these factors would be the ""most considerable risk"" for tech stocks in the following months, he added.

The year-over-year revenue growth from the product, however, was slower than from its Mac lineups and the Services segment. Apple announced the current iteration of the iPhone – the iPhone 13 – on Sept. 14, 2021.

The specter of higher interest rates amid the Fed's signal to remove monetary policy accommodation was the initial trigger that set off the sell-off in the space. The Russia-Ukraine war served to aggravate the weakness, with the geopolitical tension manifesting as component shortages and input cost inflation. Although Apple stock is down 6% year-to-date, it has notched up fairly decent gains since the launch of the iPhone 13. A $1,000 investment in Apple on Sep. 13, 2021, a day ahead of the launch date, would have fetched 6.7 shares of Apple. The same 6.7 shares would be worth $1,084 at the current price, suggesting a return of 8.4% over a seven-month time frame. The returns, though not robust, are commendable compared to the roughly 11% drop for the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) and 1% pullback by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).","Here's How Much $1,000 Invested In Apple When The iPhone 13 Was Launched Is Worth Right Now. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is among the top choices for any portfolio, given its disruptive potential, active installed base that is ever swelling and high-margin Services business that promises to grow at an astounding pace. Cupertino is by far the largest global corporation by market value. Even with the stock's advance, the valuation hasn't yet become prohibitive. Of the 29 analysts rating the stock, 23 have Buy ratings, while the remaining have Hold ratings, according to TipRanks.

The NASDAQ 100 is an index that tracks the price of the largest 100 companies on NASDAQ that aren’t in the financial sector. SQQQ is designed to move in the opposite direction of the NASDAQ 100. This ETF also uses leverage. This makes it move three times the amount of the percentage move in QQQs. For example, if the QQQs are down by 1%, SQQQ should gain about 3%. If they’re down by 2%, SQQQ should move up about 6%, and so on. This means if the stock market continues to head lower, SQQQ will continue to rip higher. But investors need to exercise caution. Leverage is great if a position goes the right way, but if not, it can also lead to increased losses. If the market rallies and moves higher, SQQQ will drop by about three times the amount.

"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 07:37:47 -0400",Tech Under Pressure? Samsung Warns Of Macro Risks Persisting Through The Year,"The tech space has spearheaded the market sell-off seen since the start of the year, as evident from the more than 20% drop for The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) in the year-to-date period. A host of negative catalysts have worked in unison to plot the downfall of this market-leading sector. It now appears that the negative triggers have further legs to play out. What Happened: South Korean electronics giant Samsung expects macroeconomic risks to persist in the second half, a statement from the company showed on Thursday. On the earnings call, the company repeatedly delved into the risks that include the potential impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, surging inflation, and COVID-19 lockdowns in China, Bloomberg reported. ""It is an immense challenge to predict the duration of market ripple effects of various macro issues such as the Russian-Ukraine war and global inflation,"" Jinman Han, executive vice president for Samsung's memory chip business reportedly said. Samsung, however, reported a 51% jump in first-quarter operating profit to 14.12 trillion won ($11 billion) and record revenue of 77.78 trillion won. The company said its mobile and appliance business – called Device Experience - recorded the highest revenue since 2013, while the chip and display business, collectively called Device Solutions, notched up record quarterly revenues. Revenue from server memory chips was at a record, the company added. To tackle uncertainties stemming from the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical issues, Samsung said it will prioritize advanced processes for components and strengthen the premium lineup and leadership position in the DX business. Related Link: Samsung Guides To Strong Q1 Operating Profit Growth: Does This Have Readthrough For Chip Demand? Why It's Important: China's COVID-19 resurgence has become the latest threat that poses a downside risk for the tech sector. Suppliers and assemblers of the majority of the big techs have plants in China. Lockdowns in the country have disrupted production plans of the suppliers and in turn these high-and-mighty tech stocks. Much of the impact will be felt in the second quarter, as COVID struck toward the end of the first quarter. The magnitude of the impact will depend on how quickly the suppliers ramp up production. TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently warned that ""the worst for the tech stocks may yet to come."" Kuo, however, said the mitigating impact could come from gradual production resumption in China, positive guidance/commentary from tech companies on the earnings calls, and a technical rebound from depressed levels.

On the earnings call, the company repeatedly delved into the risks that include the potential impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, surging inflation, and COVID-19 lockdowns in China, Bloomberg reported. ""It is an immense challenge to predict the duration of market ripple effects of various macro issues such as the Russian-Ukraine war and global inflation,"" Jinman Han, executive vice president for Samsung's memory chip business reportedly said. Samsung, however, reported a 51% jump in first-quarter operating profit to 14.12 trillion won ($11 billion) and record revenue of 77.78 trillion won. The company said its mobile and appliance business – called Device Experience - recorded the highest revenue since 2013, while the chip and display business, collectively called Device Solutions, notched up record quarterly revenues. Revenue from server memory chips was at a record, the company added. To tackle uncertainties stemming from the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical issues, Samsung said it will prioritize advanced processes for components and strengthen the premium lineup and leadership position in the DX business.

Why It's Important: China's COVID-19 resurgence has become the latest threat that poses a downside risk for the tech sector. Suppliers and assemblers of the majority of the big techs have plants in China. Lockdowns in the country have disrupted production plans of the suppliers and in turn these high-and-mighty tech stocks. Much of the impact will be felt in the second quarter, as COVID struck toward the end of the first quarter. The magnitude of the impact will depend on how quickly the suppliers ramp up production. TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently warned that ""the worst for the tech stocks may yet to come."" Kuo, however, said the mitigating impact could come from gradual production resumption in China, positive guidance/commentary from tech companies on the earnings calls, and a technical rebound from depressed levels.

"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 17:24:50 -0400","Apple's Q2 Exceeds Expectations Buoyed By Record Services Revenue, Authorizes $90B Stock Buyback","Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered another strong quarter, just ahead of the intensification of supply chain issues due to COVID disruptions in China. The top- and bottom-line outperformance was driven by record Services revenue and strength across all products, except for the iPad. The installed base of active devices rose to a record, signaling strong momentum going forward. Apple's Key Q2 Metrics: Apple reported fiscal year second-quarter earnings of $1.52 per share, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.43. This compares to the year-ago EPS of $1.40 per share and the previous quarter's $2.10. Revenue climbed 9% year-over-year from $89.6 billion to $97.3 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated revenue of $93.89 billion, according to Benzinga Pro data. The number represented a record for the March quarter. Sequentially, the top line fell 21.5% from the first quarter's $123.9 billion, which marked an all-time record. The first quarter is the seasonally strongest period for Apple as it encompasses the key holiday selling period. ""This quarter's record results are a testament to Apple's relentless focus on innovation and our ability to create the best products and services in the world,"" said CEO Tim Cook. Gross margin came in at 43.7% compared to 43.8% in the first quarter and 42.5% in the year-ago quarter. Apple's board declared a dividend of 23 cents per share, payable on May 12, to shareholders of record, as of May 9. This represented an increase from the 22 cents per share dividend paid out in the first quarter. The company noted that it generated $28 billion in operating cash flow and returned about $27 billion to shareholders during the quarter. See Also: How Apple Stock Looks Heading Into Q2 Earnings Print Revenue By Product Category: Apple reported year-over-year revenue growth for all product categories, except the iPad. Sequentially, the company saw revenue growth for the iPad and the Services segment. ""We are very pleased with our record business results for the March quarter, as we set an all-time revenue record for Services and March quarter revenue records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Continued strong customer demand for our products helped us achieve an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,"" said CFO Luca Maestri. Ahead of the quarterly results, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said she expects better-than-expected quarterly results, with iPhone 13 and Mac strength more than offsetting relative underperformance in iPad and Services. Revenue By Geography: Apple's year-over-year revenue growth was led by the Americas segment, while Europe and Greater China also saw decent growth. Japan and the rest of Asia-Pacific experienced declines compared to a year ago. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, all the regions, except Japan reported revenue declines. What Lies Ahead: It has been nearly two years since Apple issued a concrete guidance for the running quarter but has been providing directional insights on the earnings call. The company's management will host a call with analysts at 5 p.m. EDT. This time around, the situation is trickier. Consumer spending has weakened amid rate hike fears and the Ukraine-Russia war has stoked input cost inflation and rendered components in short supply. The latest crisis to rock the tech world in the resurgence of COVID in China that forced closure of production plants of several suppliers. Apple's Mac assembler Quanta Computer and iPhone contract manufacturer Pegatron were all forced to shutter operations. Investors may be keen to find out how much of hardware volume will be impacted by supply chain disruptions and when things will return to normalcy. Analysts, on average, expect Apple to report June quarter EPS of $1.25 on revenue of $86.49 billion. Huberty called for a more cautious June commentary. She, however, recommended buying ahead of product launch catalysts scheduled for the second half of the year.

The sell-off has rendered the valuation reasonable, with the price-to-earnings ratio for Apple currently at 26.59.

Not because it should be modeled, but because investors can learn from the Ark Invest CEO's mistakes and hope to avoid falling into the same traps. What To Know: Wood's flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), continues to fall as growth stocks remain under pressure amid uncertainty surrounding Fed rate hikes and ongoing geopolitical tensions, but Wood continues to relentlessly buy in the face of steep declines. Teladoc Health Inc (NYSE:TDOC) shares tanked by 40% following its weak financial results on Thursday. Wood stepped in and bought 609,665 shares of the virtual health company following the sell-off. Wood continues to reaffirm her expectations for significant price appreciation in the innovation space over a five-year period. Why It Matters: The Ark Innovation ETF has underperformed the market significantly since its inception, proprietary trader at Bright Trading and PreMarket Prep co-host Dennis Dick said Friday on Benzinga's ""PreMarket Prep."" ""A lot of people have learned the hard way and she's going to eventually learn the hard way too and she is by her eight-year underperformance of her fund so I'm using it as a teaching tool,"" Dick said.

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares are down about 40% in the year-to-period, markedly underperforming the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). The latter, considered a proxy for blue-chip tech performance, has fallen a more modest 20% during the same period. Will the first-quarter earnings report help stem the stock slide? Key Metrics To Watch For: AMD is expected to report first-quarter earnings per share of 91 cents. This compares to the year-ago quarter's 52 cents and the December quarter's 92 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expect the company to report revenues of $5.52 billion, representing a 60.30% year-over-year growth and 14.4% sequential increase. The company had in February guided to revenue of $5 billion, give or take $100 million. Rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reported a 7% year-over-year revenue decline last week but managed to beat expectations both on the top and bottom line. AMD expects the gross margin to expand from 50% in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 50.5%. ""We see revenues for the quarter being driven by strength across the board in key product areas and in higher server and client revenue offset by supply constraints,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said ahead of the earnings. AMD reports under two business segments — Computer and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom. The former includes desktop and notebook processors, chipsets, GPUs, and data center, and the latter consists of the server and embedded processors, system-on-a-chip products and gaming console products and services. The tidings from the PC end market are not very positive. Intel reported a 6% quarter-over-quarter decline in Client Computing Group revenues, weighed down by consumer PC softness and inventory digestion in the channel. Market research firm Gartner said that worldwide PC shipments fell 6.8% year-over-year in the first quarter following a 10% growth in 2021. Related Link: Why This Analyst Recommends AMD And These 3 Chip Stocks As His Favorite Semiconductor Plays Forward Outlook: Despite the challenges faced by the tech sector, analysts are optimistic of AMD continuing to grow at a robust clip in 2022. The consensus estimates call for second-quarter earnings of 99 cents per share on revenues of $6.38 billion, up 65.8% year-over-year. For the full-year, Street estimates EPS and revenue of $4 and $25.15 billion, respectively. AMD had previously guided to full-year revenue of $21.5 billion. Intel issued a soft guidance for the second quarter, citing inventory challenges in the wake of China lockdowns and inflation. Earnings Call Focal Points: When chief executive officer Lisa Su and her executive team host the earnings call, AMD investors may be keen to find out how supply chain constraints will impact the company's businesses going forward. Rosenblatt's Mosesmann also expects the company to provide insights into PC and data center demand and intra-quarter revenue contribution from the recent Xilinx acquisition. AMD Stock Take: AMD stock has recently bounced off support around $84. On the upside, the stock has resistance around $99.40. To make a meaningful move above that the stock has to go past the psychological resistance of $100. Following the release of the fourth-quarter results in early February, the stock jumped over 5% in a single session.

Excluding the contribution from Xilinx, revenue was at $5.33 billion. The company completed the Xilinx acquisition in mid-February. Rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) last week reported a 7% year-over-year revenue decline, but managed to expectations both on the top and bottom line. AMD's GAAP gross margin contracted from 50% in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 48%, with the company blaming the decline on the amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP gross margin, however, expanded 660 basis points year-over-year and by 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 53%. Excluding Xilinx, the non-GAAP gross margin was at 51%. ""The first quarter marked a significant inflection point in our journey to scale and transform AMD as we delivered record revenue and closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx,"" said AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su. AMD generated cash from operations of $995 million and free cash flow of $924 million, both representing records. AMD's Segmental Performance: The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker reported record revenue for its two business segments, namely Computing & Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom. AMD attributed the strength in Computing & Graphics segment to strong Ryzen and Radeon processor sales. GPU average selling price increased year-over-year due to high-end Radeon processor sales, while sequentially, it fell due to a lower mix of data center GPU revenue. Operating income from the segment stood at a record $723 million. Higher EPYC server processor sales, semi-custom and embedded product sales lifted the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. The segment generated operating income of $881 million.

The consensus estimates call for second-quarter earnings of 99 cents per share on revenues of $6.38 billion. AMD lifted its full-year revenue guidance from $21.5 billion to $26.3 billion, ahead of the consensus of $25.15 billion. The company expects non-GAAP gross margin to improve to 54%. Intel issued a soft guidance for the second quarter, citing inventory challenges in the wake of China lockdowns and inflation. Earnings Call Focal Points: When Su and her executive team host the earnings call, AMD investors may want to find out about how supply chain constraints will impact the company's businesses going forward. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann expects the company to provide insights into PC and data center demand and intra-quarter revenue contribution from the recent Xilinx acquisition. AMD Stock Take: AMD shares are down about 38% in the year-to-period, markedly underperforming the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). The latter, considered a proxy for blue-chip tech performance, has fallen a more modest 20% during the same period. The stock has recently bounced off a support around $84.

The 2022 FinTwit Conference will be held May 13-14 at the ARIA Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Benzinga has been there in the best of times, and we'll be there when the going gets tough. We want to be helpful now, more than ever, and be the resource you need to keep your head above water. That is why we’ve recruited the expertise of Mark Minervini, one of the leading momentum investors in the world, to help us make sense of these trying times. Last year, Minervini won the U.S. Investing Championship by posting a record return of 348%. More important than his impressive gains is Minervini’s ability to preserve capital.

This content is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investing advice. Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reported a decline in a number of U.S. funds tracking major indices, including the Nasdaq 100 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the S&P 500 Index for the trading period between May 9 to May 13, 2022. News of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)’s declining acceleration, however, served the markets with a little bit of a psychological breather. Since the announcement on May 11, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced two consecutive days of price ascension, closing the week at $401.72 per share. Global markets have also crept up this week. Cboe reported a rise in a number of European market proxies, including Germany’s DAX 30, France’s CAC 40 and Europe’s MSCI European. Brian Armstrong’s Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) wins chart of the week following a potent reaction to an earnings report that was not aligned with analyst estimates. Finally, Cboe noted important upcoming earnings that may lift investors’ eyebrows in the following week. Quick Bites Exchange-Traded Funds The SPDR S&P 500 ETF declined 2.34% last week, wallowing in its longest weekly losing streak since 2011. The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) declined 2.36% last week, recording its sixth consecutive week of price depreciation. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) declined 2.47% last week, recording its fourth consecutive week of price falloff. The Cboe Volatility Index™ decreased 4.44% last week after failing to break above 35 for the second week in a row. World Markets The MSCI European ETF (NYSE:IEUR) increased 0.21% week-on-week. The iShares FTSE 100 (LSE: ISF) increased 0.43% week-on-week. The iShares DAX 30 (BIT: EXS1) increased 2.56% week-on-week. The Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) increased 1.91% week-on-week. Chart Of The Week: COIN This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase dropped 18 points – nearly 25% – in the aftermarket hours as a result of a disappointing earnings report. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) stood at a loss of $1.98 per share, a major deviation from the $0.08 EPS analyst estimate. The company’s revenue totaled $1.166 billion, another shortcoming to the $1.5 billion analyst estimate. Shares of COIN dropped to a low of $40.81 the day after earnings were released, representing a nearly 43% decline from the pre-earnings price. COIN’s statement that users could lose their crypto holdings if the company goes bankrupt likely played a role in this dramatic movement. The company’s stock price, however, has since recovered and climbed back to pre-earnings report levels as the S&P 500 climbed 3.15% in two days. Major Cryptos At the time of writing: Bitcoin (BTC) declined 13.2%, representing its seventh week of consecutive decline and breaching below $28,000 for the first time since January 2021. Ethereum (ETH) declined 20.68%, representing its sixth week of consecutive decline. Solana (SOL) declined 33.5%, representing its sixth week of consecutive decline and revisiting price levels held in April 2021. Upcoming Earnings And Catalysts May 17th Walmart Inc.

Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reported a price ascension in a number of international and local markets for the May 23-27 trading period. Specifically, the Nasdaq 100 Index, Russell 2000 Index and S&P 500 Index all reported increases last week as did European market proxies like Europe’s MSCI European and the United Kingdom’s iShares FTSE 100. Bharat Masrani’s Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) wins chart of the week following a steady reaction to an earnings report that outperformed estimates.

"Fri, 03 Jun 2022 15:33:53 -0400","How Much $1,000 Invested In Apple Stock At 2021 WWDC Is Worth Now","Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) software-focused annual Worldwide Developers Conference is scheduled to be held June 6-10. Although the WWDC is less glamorous relative to fall hardware launch events, the company does make meaningful announcements, especially regarding the operating system that powers its hardware. What to Expect From WWDC 2022: The WWDC 2022 kicks off with a keynote address on June 6 at 1 p.m. ET, when the company is expected to announce the new launches. The company is allowing limited in-person attendance this time around. The keynote will be followed by the ""Platforms State of the Union"" at 4 p.m. ET on the same day. Apple has also planned for sessions and labs, at which Apple engineers and exports provide one-on-one guidance, as well as digital lounges and challenges, among other options. Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said last weekend he expects the next iteration of the iPhone OS, named iOS 16, to represent a significant upgrade from the previous version. The Apple specialist mentioned the ""always-on"" lock screen support and updates to notifications, iPad Multitasking and the Messages and Health apps, among the changes he is bracing for. Gurman also said the next-gen MacBook Air with M2 chips will likely make its appearance at the conference, although COVID-19 lockdowns in China could pour cold water on the company's plans. Most Apple watchers and analysts are resigned to the fact that Apple's next-big hardware product, namely the MR headset, and/or the realityOS, won't be launched at the conference. Could the event be a stock mover? Tracking how Cupertino's stock has reacted to the WWDC historically, it appears the stock does not budge during the week of the event. The annual affair, however, signals an inflection point in Apple's stock, which historically outperforms in the second half of the year due to many different factors. Related Link: Apple's AR/VR Headset: Watch For These Updates At WWDC Next Week $1,000 Invested At WWDC 2021 Start: Apple held its WWDC on June 7-11 in 2021. The announcements at the event were more cosmetic in nature than radical. Some of the key features unveiled included mail privacy protection, FaceTime scheduling, music, video and document sharing features, Apple Wallet driver's license support and watchOS biomarker update. Apple analyst and Loup Funds Managing Partner Gene Munster had said then, ""From a high level, this year, and maybe even next year's WWDC event will amount to a calm before an Apple innovation storm."" If you invested $1,000 in Apple on June 4, 2021, the session ahead of WWDC's 2021 start, it would have bought an investor roughly eight Apple shares. The same number of shares are currently worth roughly $1,210 now (taking into account Thursday's closing price of $151.21). This would mean the investor would have realized a decent return of 21% over a one-year period. The return looks all the more appealing when compared to the mere 0.1% return for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) during the same period. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is down about 6% over the past year. AAPL Price Action: Apple shares were seen down 4.08% at $145.04 on Friday afternoon, according to Benzinga Pro data.

"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 14:50:01 -0400","Stock Bloodbath Continues, Pushing S&P 500 Into Bear Market Ahead Of Critical Fed Meeting","The S&P 500 officially dropped into bear market territory Monday as global financial markets continue to decline following the latest round of U.S. inflation data. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was trading lower by 2.7% on Monday, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSE:DIA) dropped 2% and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) dropped 3.5%. Fed In Focus: Selling pressure from Friday continued on Wall Street after the Labor Department reported an 8.6% increase in the consumer price index in May, the highest inflation reading in any month since 1981. The Federal Open Market Committee begins its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The market is pricing in a 70.8% chance the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 0.5% at this week's meeting, but chances of a 0.75% rate hike have now risen to 29.2%, according to CME Group. ""The idea that there is some Goldilocks outcome in the cards or soft landing is a mockery,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Quill Intelligence, said Monday. ""Consumer sentiment is at record lows and jobless claims have surged since bottoming in mid-March, leaving little doubt that the U.S. has entered recession."" Related Link: 'Stunningly High': Experts React To 8.6% CPI Inflation, Highest In 40 Years The S&P 500 dropped as low as 3,750 on Monday, its lowest level since March 2021. The index has now dropped more than 20% from its all-time high of 4,818 in January and has crossed over into bear market territory. There have been 14 bear markets since the end of World War II. The median bear market decline has been 30% from recent highs, and the average downturn has lasted an average of 359 days, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Risk Assets On The Move: Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), took a big hit on Monday as well as investors concerned about rampant inflation dumped risk assets. Bitcoin prices dropped 15.9% to around $23,500, while Ethereum prices fell 18.3% to around $1,230. Big tech stocks were among the hardest hit on Monday morning. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares dropped 6.3%, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell 6.1% and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares declined 4.9%. Benzinga's Take: It seems unlikely at this point the FOMC will raise interest rates by 0.75% this week given that investors could interpret a hike that large as a sign of panic from the Fed. Investors should expect a 0.5% rate hike, but the tone of the accompanying commentary by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely have a significant impact on investor sentiment moving forward.

"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 09:43:04 -0400",Cboe's Weekly Market Recap: June 6th To 10th,"Exciting developments occurred on the Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) this week. Lending a throwback to its earliest days, Cboe celebrated the grand opening of its new trading floor in Chicago, where it was founded in 1973 as the first listed options exchange in the United States. Located in the historic Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Building, Cboe's new trading floor occupies more than 40,000 square feet on the seventh and eighth floors, with double-height floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook Chicago's historic LaSalle Street financial district. The exciting initiative is a mesh of past and present, combining the open outcry trading methods that defined the early 1990s with today’s cutting-edge technology. ""Our new and enhanced trading floor offers a vibrant, technology-driven environment that seamlessly integrates both open outcry and electronic trading mechanisms to provide our customers a truly unrivaled, world-class trading experience. We believe this dynamic new space will serve our customers and investors well — now and for years to come,” said Chris Isaacson, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Cboe Global Markets. Market Movements Overview The beginning of last week’s market movements suggested another dull week with major exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) stuck in consolidation zones. The last two trading days, however, radically shifted this view. Spurred by a consumer price index (CPI) report of above-average forecasts, the market broke out of its consolidation zone and tumbled significantly downward. The technology sector was hit particularly hard as was the European equities market. Andrew Robins’ Cogent Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ:COGT) provides a nice break from the market’s overall pessimism, capturing Cboe’s chart of the week following a runup to a positive news catalyst. Finally, Cboe notes important upcoming earnings that may lift investors’ eyebrows in the coming weeks. Quick Bites Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) The SPDR S&P 500 ETF decreased 5.05% week-on-week, wiping out the 12-point upside move that occurred just two weeks ago. The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF decreased 5.67% last week, exhibiting a similar weakness to the SPDR S&P500 ETF. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF decreased 2.71% last week, following in the footsteps of the larger market proxies. The Cboe Volatility Index® increased 11.85% last week, its first increase in five weeks. World Markets The iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE:IEUR) decreased 7.98% week-on-week. The iShares FTSE 100 (LSE: ISF) decreased 2.91% week-on-week. The iShares Core DAX 30 (BIT: EXS1) decreased 4.82% week-on-week. The Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) decreased 4.48% week-on-week. Chart Of The Week: COGT This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Shares of Cogent Biosciences, a biopharmaceutical company finding solutions to genetic diseases, increased nearly 60% following news that it had reported positive clinical trials for a new drug. The stock price rose from $4.96 a share to $7.87 a share the day of the news release. It had run to a high of $10.89 — a 120% increase in one day — before settling at $7.87. Despite this positive catalyst, Cogent Biosciences missed estimates on every earnings release since May 2021, and its stock has toppled nearly 80% since its initial public offering. Major Cryptos At the time of writing: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) decreased by 6.67%, erasing last week’s gain in its entirety. Ether (CRYPTO: ETH) declined by 16.53%, representing its 10th consecutive week of decline. Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) declined 12.9%, representing its 10th consecutive week of decline. Upcoming Earnings And Catalysts June 13-17 Earnings Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ:ORCL), John Wiley & Sons Inc. (NYSE:WLY) and Adobe Inc.

Well, Maley is an equities strategist and market commentator with over 25 years of experience at two of Wall Street's most major institutional trading desks, Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch, where he covered some of the world's most influential hedge funds. Maley, now partnered with Benzinga, operates an exclusive chatroom with a limited number of approved traders on a first-come, first-served basis where he shares insights on his own trades and trade suggestions for others. “My Stock Picks newsletters can speak for itself, with an average return per trade of over 50%. My commitment to you in this inner circle is to be accessible for you each trading day,"" Maley says. ""To give you live market commentary, the stocks I am thinking about, trade ideas, and ultimately, to help educate you to learn the way that I see the market!” It is important to note there are risks with every trade, and absolutely nothing is guaranteed. The Winning Trade: Okay, now that is out of the way — here’s the scoop. A Benzinga employee who has been following Maley’s insights for over one year took a trade that proved to be fruitful. The employee will remain nameless to protect their identity. We’ll call them Blue. Blue took a position in ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:SQQQ), which is an inverse-leveraged exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. An inverse ETF is constructed by using various derivatives to profit from a decline in the value of an underlying benchmark. Simply said, SQQQ will increase if the prices of its underlying benchmark, Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), go down. Blue was piqued by one of Maley’s signals — that QQQ prices may go down. So, he picked up 175 call-option contracts on the $65 strike in the inverse-leveraged SQQQ, paying an average premium of $1.28 for each of the 175 contracts expiring on May 27, 2022. That trade cost Blue $22,420: a big bet for anyone with a weak stomach. Though Maley’s signal proved correct, Blue netted 80% profits on the trade before executing a sale order. He walked away with $40,425, or $18,005.00 in profits. I personally messaged Blue to congratulate him on this trade. Blue said he did not set a stop loss and held the position for less than one full trading session.

"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 11:14:24 -0400",ETF Short Sellers Targeting Bond ETFs As Interest Rates Rise,"Tech stocks once again led the market lower on Wednesday as the difficult 2022 for Wall Street continued. But bad news in the market for ETF investors is good news for ETF short sellers. There is currently $241 billion in aggregate ETF short interest in the U.S. market, according to S3 Partners. S3 analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said Wednesday that ETF short interest has decreased by $13.9 billion in the past 30 days. Most Shorted ETFs: By far the most heavily shorted ETF is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). The SPY ETF tracks the S&P 500 and represents a simple bet against the U.S. stock market and/or a hedge against long positions in U.S. stocks. Here are the top four most shorted U.S. ETFs, according to S3: Related Link: Nio Analyst Dismisses Short Seller Allegations: Why They're Bullish On Chinese EV Stock SPY ETF, $69.4 billion in short interest. PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), $22.7 billion in short interest. iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWM), $18.7 billion in short interest. iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:HYG), $8.1 billion in short interest. Recent Short Seller Targets: Overall, Dusaniwsky said traders have been ramping up bets against bond ETFs as interest rates rise. Related Link: Short Seller Spruce Point Targets Generac, Alleges 'Numerous Shady M&A Deals' “The $3.34 billion of net ETF short selling over the past 30 days saw the biggest moves in the 'hedging ETFs' with the Spider S&P 500 ETF (SPY), iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corp Bond ETF (NYSE:LQD) and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE:TLT) having $6.2 billion of new short selling over the last thirty days and the iShares Russell 3000 ETF (IWM) with $1.9 billion of short covering,” he said. In addition to the IWM ETF, short sellers have also been aggressively covering bets against the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP), iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) and Invesco S&P 500 Eql Wght ETF (NYSE:RSP) funds as well. Finally, for investors looking for the next ETF short squeeze candidate, S3 ranked the following four funds as the most crowded short trades, based on S3's Crowded Score metric: Invesco Senior Loan ETF (NYSE:BKLN), 92.5 Crowded Score. IWM ETF, 87.5 Crowded Score. HYG ETF, 87.5 Crowded Score. SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT), 87.5 Crowded Score. Benzinga’s Take: The general theme of the information above is that investors are betting against bond ETFs, likely in anticipation of higher interest rates ahead. At the same time, short sellers appear to be dialing back their exposure to consumer staples and software stocks.","ETF Short Sellers Targeting Bond ETFs As Interest Rates Rise.

Most Shorted ETFs: By far the most heavily shorted ETF is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). The SPY ETF tracks the S&P 500 and represents a simple bet against the U.S. stock market and/or a hedge against long positions in U.S. stocks. Here are the top four most shorted U.S. ETFs, according to S3: Related Link: Nio Analyst Dismisses Short Seller Allegations: Why They're Bullish On Chinese EV Stock SPY ETF, $69.4 billion in short interest. PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), $22.7 billion in short interest. iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWM), $18.7 billion in short interest. iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:HYG), $8.1 billion in short interest. Recent Short Seller Targets: Overall, Dusaniwsky said traders have been ramping up bets against bond ETFs as interest rates rise.

In addition to the IWM ETF, short sellers have also been aggressively covering bets against the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP), iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) and Invesco S&P 500 Eql Wght ETF (NYSE:RSP) funds as well. Finally, for investors looking for the next ETF short squeeze candidate, S3 ranked the following four funds as the most crowded short trades, based on S3's Crowded Score metric: Invesco Senior Loan ETF (NYSE:BKLN), 92.5 Crowded Score. IWM ETF, 87.5 Crowded Score. HYG ETF, 87.5 Crowded Score. SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT), 87.5 Crowded Score. Benzinga’s Take: The general theme of the information above is that investors are betting against bond ETFs, likely in anticipation of higher interest rates ahead. At the same time, short sellers appear to be dialing back their exposure to consumer staples and software stocks.",,

"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 09:33:27 -0400",CBOE's Weekly Market Recap: July 11 To 15,"Caught in the ebb and flow of a bear market, the world’s stock markets seemed to be taking another breather last week. Following months of downward movement, the markets reached a stalemate around many of the world’s top stock-tracking indices last week. Specifically, the SPDR S&P500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has decreased less than 1% throughout the week, forming what stock chart technicians will call a “Doji candle” at the lows. Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reports that other global indices — like those reflected in iShares FTSE 100 (LSE: ISF) and iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) — mirrored this constricted price movement, with weekly movements falling below 1% for each. Entering earnings season, Cboe also reports several eye-catching earnings releases — most notably from BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) — that have spurred the creation of many press headlines and quick-fire investments from traders. BlackRock’s surprising response to a historic earnings release won it “chart of the week” in this weekly recap. Finally, Cboe notes important upcoming earnings that may lift investors’ eyebrows in the following weeks. Quick Bites Exchange-Traded Funds The SPDR S&P 500 ETF decreased by 0.91% last week, forming a long downward “tail” that some technical analysts would regard as evidence of buying pressure. The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) decreased by 1.18% last week, forming a similar tail to that of the S&P500 ETF. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) decreased by 1.42% last week, following in the footsteps of macrocap indices. The Cboe Volatility Index™ (INDEXCBOE: VIX) decreased by 1.74% last week, representing the fifth consecutive week of decline. World Markets The iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE:IEUR) decreased by 1.37% week-on-week. The iShares FTSE 100 (LSE: ISF) increased by 0.93% week-on-week. The iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) increased by 0.28% week-on-week. The Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) increased by 0.12% week-on-week. Chart Of The Week: BLK This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Shares of world-renowned investment management corporation BlackRock climbed 2% the day following its first earnings miss since last July. The company surprised Wall Street analysts by reporting earnings per share (EPS) 6.49% below the $7.87 estimate. Additionally, BlackRock missed its revenue projections, reporting $4.526 billion in revenue as opposed to the expected $4.553. Given reports that the asset management company lost $1.7 billion worth of clients’ assets in the first six months of 2022, it’s perhaps a surprise to many that the company’s stock is up roughly 7.8% since its pre-earnings day close. Major Cryptos Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) decreased 0.28%, experiencing its fourth consecutive week of price consolidation between the $18,000 and $22,500 levels. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) increased 14.6% after the release of a concrete date for The Merge. Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) increased 5.26% and closed at a price of $41.07 per coin. Recent And Upcoming Earnings Releases Recent Earnings Many of America’s biggest financial institutions have followed the earnings trend — and subsequent stock price movement — of the chart of the week winner: BlackRock. Specifically, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have all missed their earnings estimates, citing an EPS miss of 8.05%, 7.92% and 4.54%, respectively. Despite the presence of earnings misses across the financial sector, there were a few exceptions. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) and Charles Shwab Corp. (NYSE:SCHW) represent two of these. The two reported an EPS positive surprise of 30.59% and 6.67%, respectively. Citigroup’s price rally — perhaps because of this huge surprise — was the strongest of the bunch. Upcoming Earnings United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS), Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD), Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), Boeing Co.

"Tue, 02 Aug 2022 09:18:25 -0400",AMD Q2 May Show Share Gains At Intel's Expense: Q2 Earnings Preview,"Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMD) second-quarter earnings are on tap on Tuesday after the market close. Q2 Expectations: Santa Clara, California-based AMD is widely expected to report second-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, higher than the year-ago EPS of $0.63 per share. In the prior quarter, the bottom line was at $1.13 per share. Analysts, on average, estimate revenue to jump about 70% year-over-year from $3.85 billion to $6.53 billion. This matches the 71% year-over-year revenue growth pace seen for the first quarter of 2022, when topline was at $5.89 billion. AMD had guided to second-quarter revenue of $6.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann is modeling above-consensus top- and bottom-line results for AMD, driven by strong CPU and GPU share gains in both consumer and data center segments, as well as strength in Xilinx FFGA trends. This will be AMD’s first full quarter reflecting the contribution from its acquisition of programmable graphics chipmaker Xilinx, which was completed in mid-February. The company’s gross margin contracted to 48% in the March quarter due to the amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Excluding Xilinx, the non-GAAP gross margin expanded by one percentage point to 51%. Rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) last week reported sub-par second quarter results, with Mosesmann blaming the shortfall on “the rapid decline in economic activity, OEM inventory adjustments, and an overall lack of execution in product design and DCAI.” Related Link: AMD, Alibaba, Starbucks Earnings On Deck As Q2 Reporting Season Passes Half-Way Mark Forward Outlook: The consensus estimates for the third quarter call for non-GAAP EPS of $1.09 and revenue of $6.82 billion. Rosenblatt sees upside to estimates in the third quarter, thanks to market share gains. AMD had in April raised its full-year revenue guidance to $26.3 billion. Analysts, on average, model non-GAAP EPS and revenue of $4.38 and $26.18 billion, respectively. Earnings Call Focal Points: Rosenblatt’s Mosesmann said he's looking ahead to AMD’s commentary on: next-generation CPU - Zen 4-based Ryzen 7000 and EPYC 4 next-generation RDNA/CDNA GPU roadmaps early synergies that Xilinx FPGAs bring to broader end markets such as communications, data center, automotive, and industrial. AMD’s supply situation AMD’s Stock Take: AMD shares have pulled back along with the tech stocks and are down about 32.7% year-to-date. This compares to the 12.9% drop for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and a 20.5% pullback by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ).

AMD said it saw strength in the data center and embedded segments, with growth slowing elsewhere. The company maintained its full-year guidance. AMD’s Key Q2 Metrics: AMD’s second-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.05, higher than the consensus estimate of $1.03 and the year-ago EPS of 63 cents. In the prior quarter, the bottom line was $1.13 per share. Revenue rose 70% year-over-year to $6.55 billion and slightly exceeded the consensus estimate of $6.53 billion.

The second quarter marked the first full quarter that incorporated the contribution from Xilinx, which was acquired in February. AMD's gross margin contracted 140 basis points to 46%, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. The non-GAAP margin improved 640 basis points year-over-year to 54%. “We delivered our eighth straight quarter of record revenue based on our strong execution and expanded product portfolio,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su.

The Xilinx acquisition that was completed in February benefitted the embedded segment's revenue, which jumped 2,228% to $1.3 billion.

Big Techs","The market has shown signs of turning around in recent sessions, prompting many analysts to call for a bottom. That said, there’s limited visibility into the near- and medium-term, given the looming uncertainty around inflation and interest rates. Uncertainties Weigh Down: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index, is currently down about 12% in the year-to-date period. The current market downturn is being led by the tech sector. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, has retreated about 19%. At one point in mid-June, the SPY was down a steeper 23% but has managed to cut its losses. At its trough, the QQQ had plummeted about 32%. The underperformance of the so-called “Big Techs” is unsurprising. Some of them have heavy exposure to consumer spending, which slowed notably amid recession fears and the spike in inflation that ate into nominal spending. Meanwhile, the social-media platforms suffered due to softness in ad spending, which is their primary source of revenue. Read Benzinga’s coverage of July jobs report and its readthrough for Fed rates What Near Term Holds: Given the year-to-date underperformance, in all likelihood, the market should come back up. Valuations of most stocks, even the fundamentally sound ones, have turned attractive and this should bring bargain hunters in. The economy is now the dark horse. Non-farm payrolls data released Friday showed the economy adding a healthy 538,000 jobs in July. And there were upward revisions to the previous two months’ numbers, which boosted the job gains for the first seven months of the year by 26,000. The earnings season has been better than feared. The sore spot is the economic growth, which has been negative for two consecutive quarters – technically defined a recession. Inflation remains sticky at multi-decade highs. The Fed, which has raised the fed funds rate from 0%-0.25% at the start of the year to 2.25%-2.5% by July, is left with no option but to continue raising rates until inflation is reined in. Against this backdrop, the stock market’s fate is left to the mercy of each piece of incoming data. Although analysts have tempered their expectations for the market and stocks, they are still hopeful that things will look up in the second half. The average year-end price target for the S&P 500 is currently at 4,372, CNBC’s compilation of market strategists’ price target shows. This would mean the index will end down by 8.3%. Returns Of Broader Market By Year-End: Assuming the SPY clocks the same drop as the S&P 500 Index, it is on track to end the year at $432. A $1,000 invested in SPY currently will fetch 2.4 units of the ETF. This would be worth 1,036.8 at the end of the year, a gain of 3.68%. Here’s how this compares with the potential returns for the big techs, assuming they hit the consensus price target (compiled by TipRanks): Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): +35.4% Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX): +1.1% Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): 8.93% Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN): +25% Alphabet, Inc.

As of Aug. 3, the ETF appeared to be holding this price ascension, rising 0.60% in a three-day trading period and holding over highs created in last week’s rally. A glimpse at other market proxies around the world shows similarly optimistic sentiment. Specifically, Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reports that European exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (LSE: ISF) and iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) reaped positive returns last week, with local ETFs like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) following suit.

And at the same time, the market seems to be ignoring all of the potential risk factors out there like geopolitics, growth slowing, layoffs, etc.,"" Luke Lloyd, Wealth Advisor & Investment Strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners told Benzinga. Main Street Data On Tap: The University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment data for August is due at 10 a.m. ET. Economists, on average, expect the headline index to show an improvement — from 51.5 to 52.5 in July. The report also has an inflation gauge in the form of the inflation expectations index, which is a leading indicator as it reflects consumer expectations regarding inflation a year ahead. In July, the reading was at 5.2%. The Labor Department is set to release the import and export prices report for July at 8:30 a.m. ET. Given it is a second-tier report, it may not be market-moving. That said, the market reaction may be counter-intuitive for some. ""The market psychology has changed significantly since the pandemic. Good news seems to be bad news and bad news seems to be good news. Bad news just means more liquidity pumped into the system via stimulus & the Fed being more accommodative. Good news means less liquidity and room for the Fed to get more aggressive.,"" Lloyd added, noting that, ""the question is, when will bad news actually be bad news again? That's the trillion dollar question."" Read Wedbush’s review of Q2 tech reporting season and its tech recommendations Pre-Market Movers: Earnings news continues to dictate sentiment around individual stocks. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is pulling back after its earnings release, although most of its EV peers, including market leader Tesla, Inc. (NASDA: TSLA) were seen trading higher. Pennsylvania-based clinical-stage biotech Larimar Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:LRMR) is spiking on positive regulatory development. Penny stock Kiora Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:KPRX) is seen shooting higher amid no news. Nutraceutical and cannabis company Neptune Wellness, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEPT), which last month delisted from the Toronto stock exchange, is adding one-half to its market cap. Molecular diagnostics companies Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) and Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CODX) are pulling back following their disappointing quarterly results. This could potentially trigger weaknesses in peers. Overseas Cues: Sentiment in Asia was somber, with the exception of Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index, which saw a catch-up rally after remaining closed on Thursday. After advancing over 2.5% on Thursday, September crude futures are continuing to move higher, albeit with a slower momentum. European stocks are moderately higher as investors shrugged off a weak GDP report from the United Kingdom. The U.K. economy contracted for the first time since early last year, shrinking by 0.1% quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said in a report. The decline was slower than the 0.3% contraction expected by economists. Thursday, U.S. stocks closed mixed, squandering some of the early gains built on the back of the producer price inflation report for July, which confirmed the softening inflationary trend. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.58% and the S&P 500 Index ended marginally lower, while Walt Disney, Inc. (NYSE:DIS) 4.68% rally helped the Dow edge higher by a small 0.08%.

At last check, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was adding 0.40% to $421.68 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was seen advancing 0.52% to $325.77, according to Benzinga Pro data.","S&P 500, Nasdaq Futures Point Higher As Investors Await Key Consumer Sentiment Data. U.S. index futures are pointing to a moderately positive open on Wall Street on Friday following the lackluster close in the previous session. At the time of going to press, the Dow futures, the S&P futures, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.34%, 0.41%, and 0.48%, respectively. The Russell 2,000 futures were up a more modest 0.2%, suggesting sentiment is more muted among small-cap stocks. ""The stock market is trying to grab onto any kind of small positive news and act like it's bigger and more important than it really is. And at the same time, the market seems to be ignoring all of the potential risk factors out there like geopolitics, growth slowing, layoffs, etc.,"" Luke Lloyd, Wealth Advisor & Investment Strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners told Benzinga. Main Street Data On Tap: The University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment data for August is due at 10 a.m. ET. Economists, on average, expect the headline index to show an improvement — from 51.5 to 52.5 in July. The report also has an inflation gauge in the form of the inflation expectations index, which is a leading indicator as it reflects consumer expectations regarding inflation a year ahead. In July, the reading was at 5.2%. The Labor Department is set to release the import and export prices report for July at 8:30 a.m. ET. Given it is a second-tier report, it may not be market-moving. That said, the market reaction may be counter-intuitive for some. ""The market psychology has changed significantly since the pandemic. Good news seems to be bad news and bad news seems to be good news. Bad news just means more liquidity pumped into the system via stimulus & the Fed being more accommodative. Good news means less liquidity and room for the Fed to get more aggressive.,"" Lloyd added, noting that, ""the question is, when will bad news actually be bad news again? That's the trillion dollar question."" Read Wedbush’s review of Q2 tech reporting season and its tech recommendations Pre-Market Movers: Earnings news continues to dictate sentiment around individual stocks. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is pulling back after its earnings release, although most of its EV peers, including market leader Tesla, Inc. (NASDA: TSLA) were seen trading higher. Pennsylvania-based clinical-stage biotech Larimar Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:LRMR) is spiking on positive regulatory development. Penny stock Kiora Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:KPRX) is seen shooting higher amid no news. Nutraceutical and cannabis company Neptune Wellness, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEPT), which last month delisted from the Toronto stock exchange, is adding one-half to its market cap. Molecular diagnostics companies Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) and Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CODX) are pulling back following their disappointing quarterly results. This could potentially trigger weaknesses in peers. Overseas Cues: Sentiment in Asia was somber, with the exception of Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index, which saw a catch-up rally after remaining closed on Thursday. After advancing over 2.5% on Thursday, September crude futures are continuing to move higher, albeit with a slower momentum. European stocks are moderately higher as investors shrugged off a weak GDP report from the United Kingdom. The U.K. economy contracted for the first time since early last year, shrinking by 0.1% quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said in a report. The decline was slower than the 0.3% contraction expected by economists. Thursday, U.S. stocks closed mixed, squandering some of the early gains built on the back of the producer price inflation report for July, which confirmed the softening inflationary trend. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.58% and the S&P 500 Index ended marginally lower, while Walt Disney, Inc. (NYSE:DIS) 4.68% rally helped the Dow edge higher by a small 0.08%.

At the time of going to press, the S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were retreating 0.56% each. The Dow futures were down a more modest 0.44%. As seen for much of last week, small-caps could underperform, as reflected by the 0.76% pullback by the Russell 2000 futures. ""In the U.S., we are in the 'dog days of summer' and the stock market is expected to meander listlessly on light trading volume for the remainder of August. Since CNBC was touting ""meme"" stocks last week and there was a lot of short covering in low quality companies, I am expecting that the stock market will begin to consolidate after an incredible run since June 16th,"" Louis Navellier, Founder Of Navellier & Associates told Benzinga. Market Cues: The market seems to look toward a couple of Main Street data for drawing trading cues. The New York Federal Reserve is scheduled to release the results of the Empire State manufacturing survey at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists, on average, expect the headline manufacturing index to slip from 11.1 in July to 5.5 in August. A reading above zero suggests the manufacturing sector in the New York region is in expansion territory. Incidentally, the index was in contraction territory in May and June before recovering. The National Association of Home Builders will release its housing market index for August at 10 a.m. ET. The metric is expected to remain unchanged at 55 for the month. Investors may also exercise caution ahead of the retail sales report for July and the minutes of the FOMC’s July meeting, both due on Wednesday. A few Fed officials are due to make public appearances this week and their comments could potentially sway the markets. After a week of not-so-encouraging earnings reports, market attention turns to the unfolding week, which has a heavy dose of retail earnings. Notable among these are Walmart, Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Tech names, including Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Applied Materials, Inc.

Read Benzinga’s story on the past week’s market movement. Stocks moving in premarket trading: Plus Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PSTV) shares are soaring after the company presented positive data for its lead drug Rhenium-186 Nanoliposome at a CNS-related medical conference held in Canada. Unity Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ:UBX) is running on the momentum it picked up from Friday’s session when it reacted to positive data on a macular edema treatment candidate. Meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. (NYSE:BBBY) is seen extending its recent rally. Overseas Markets: The Asian markets meandered around, as investors in the region took stock of the soft data out of China. The Indian and South Korean markets remained closed for public holidays. China’s National Bureau of Statistics announced a slew of economic data, and among these retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment all came in below expectations. The negative impact of the soft data points was mitigated by the Chinese central bank’s decision to announce an unexpected rate cut to jumpstart the COVID-19-hit economy. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rallied, taking cues from strengthening GDP growth in the second quarter. European stocks opened sharply higher but have since given back much of the gains.

On Wednesday, the major averages gap-opened lower and languished mostly below the flat line, although the FOMC minutes that suggested future rate hikes could be less steep helped cut some losses. The Nasdaq Composite Index slumped by 1.25%, weighed down by the pullback in most large-cap tech stocks. Apple, Inc.

The Dow Industrials snapped a five-session winning streak before ending half a percentage point lower at 33,980.32. The S&P 500 Index — a broader market gauge, fell 0.72% to 4,274.04. At the time of going to press, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were up 0.16% and 0.13%, respectively. The Dow futures were advancing a more modest 0.11%. “If there's anything wrong with the market, it's simply because it is August,” Navellier & Associates’ Louis Navellier said in a report. He sees the second half of August to be lackluster, given the end of the earnings season, but expects the market to rally, going into the Labor Day weekend. This will likely be followed by some more consolidation, he added. “I think if you're looking for a low point in the market, September 21st is looking like a good time to add money because the Fed might have their last rate increase,” the fund manager said.

"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 07:22:34 -0400","Nasdaq, S&P 500 Futures Sink Amid Economic Uncertainty — Volatility Anticipated Ahead Of Options Expiry","Wall Street looks set for a markedly negative open on Friday, as reflected by the trading in the U.S. index futures. This follows a lackluster trading session on Thursday when the major averages opened slightly lower but recovered to stay mostly afloat before closing modestly higher. Investors were reacting to mixed data points on jobless claims and the housing market. Conflicting data is likely to keep investors on tenterhooks regarding the course of monetary policy in the near term. The 30-stock Dow Industrials index was down an insignificant 0.06% at the close, recouping some of the past session’s losses. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices lost around 0.20% each before settling at 4,283.74 and12,965.34, respectively. It remains to be seen if the S&P 500 can keep its four-week winning streak going. A the time of going to press on Friday, the Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.91%, while the S&P and Dow futures have slid 0.79% and 0.64%, respectively. Heavy volatility could be the order of the day on Friday, when $2 trillion worth of options are set to expire, Goldman Sachs analyst Rocky Fishman said, according to Bloomberg. This would require options holders to either roll over existing positions or start new positions. Fund manager Louis Navellier said in a recent report the monetary policy outlook leaves the market in a position where “reports of economic strength are seen as giving the Fed more room to increase rates aggressively without concerns of triggering a serious recession.” “Strong earners with reasonable P/Es which pull back on market dips should be bought, weak earners with outsized P/Es should be trimmed on market rallies,” he wrote. He recommends putting money to work and shifting the mix to stocks of companies, which have “demonstrated continued earnings growth in the current inflationary economy.” See Also: Is The Bear Market Over?

"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 10:32:38 -0400",CBOE's Weekly Market Recap: August 1 To August 5,"The last four weeks have been an incredible relief for the world’s markets. For one, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) recorded four consecutive weeks of price ascension, a feat unmatched since last October. Favorable consumer price index data, the Federal Reserve’s decision to pause rate hike growth and a job report that exceeded expectations seemingly provided the perfect macroeconomic catalysts for price ascension in major indices. Specifically, Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reports that European exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (LSE: ISF) and iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) reaped positive returns last week, with local ETFs like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) following suit. Cryptocurrencies have also experienced price ascensions, but these price rises have not been proportionate. In the last four weeks, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has risen nearly 100% on news of the Merge blockchain upgrade and generally bullish behavior in the markets. In comparison, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has jumped 20% and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) by 40% in a similar time frame. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) wins Chart of The Week following an incredible run-up and unusual strength relative to general market indices. Finally, Cboe notes upcoming earnings that may lift investors’ eyebrows in the week to follow. Quick Bites Exchange-Traded Funds The SPDR S&P 500 ETF increased by 3.3% last week, recording its fourth consecutive week of price ascension. The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) increased by 2.69% last week, following suit with the SPY’s overall movements. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) increased by 5.01% last week, the highest incline among the three exchange-traded funds recorded in this series. The Cboe Volatility Index™ (INDEXCBOE: VIX) decreased by 7.47% last week, falling back to levels unseen since April. World Markets The iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE:IEUR) increased by 2.52% week-on-week. The iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (LSE: ISF) increased by 1.29% week-on-week. The iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) increased by 1.62% week-on-week. The Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) increased by 1.3% week-on-week. Chart Of The Week: AAPL This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Apple shares have been on an upward trajectory since before general market indices established their upward trends. As seen in the chart above, AAPL has displayed six consecutive weeks of price ascension, two weeks more — and earlier — than the SPDR S&P500 ETF. Also apparent is the sharp bounce off the lows, which resulted in a rubber bandlike reaction in the opposite direction. Once compared to the SPY, this too shows strength. Apple — business magnate Warren Buffett’s largest investment — reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.20 and revenue of $82.959 billion on July 28. Both figures beat estimates, much like every report before it since April 2016. Major Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) increased by 4.88% but has yet to break the $25,000 level. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) increased by 13.86%. Since its low on June 18, Ether has climbed a staggering 131%. News of the Merge and a third successful testnet transition from proof of work to proof of stake is likely prompting the move. Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) increased by 10.38% and closed at a price of $44.86 per coin.

"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 16:16:02 -0400","How Much $1,000 Invested In Apple, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet In Mid-June Would Have Fetched Ahead Of Friday's Plunge","Tech stocks had an uninspiring first half, following which they collectively lost multi-billion dollars in market capitalization. Given the steep declines, investors began discounting a rebound as fundamentals improve, prompting bargain hunters to step in. Battered Tech Stocks Stem Rot: True to expectations, tech stocks did turn around after hitting a bottom in mid-June, a couple of weeks ahead of the end of the second quarter. The primary contributor to the reversal in sentiment is the expectation that monetary policy tightening could be less aggressive going forward. The U.S. economy went through a second straight quarter of contraction – technically called a recession. The data point raised leads to hopes that the Federal Reserve may not be as aggressive as they were earlier this year. The July consumer prices data showed a let-up in inflationary pressure, increasing the optimism further. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) bottomed at $269.28 on June 16 and advanced over 22% from the level to $329.28 on Thursday. The ETF pulled back by 1.95% on Friday amid the volatility associated with options expiry and some hawkish Fed speeches.

Despite the supply constraints and uncertainties around the demand side of the equation amid the economic downturn, most big techs reported fairly encouraging results. An astute investor, who may have accurately predicted the bottom and taken a position in these stocks at their mid-June lows, may have generated decent returns. How do the returns of the FAANGs compare with each other? A $1,000 invested in Meta at $154.25 (reached on June 23) would have fetched roughly 6.5 shares; This would have been worth $1,132.32 by Thursday, a return of 13.2%. A $1,000 invested in Apple at $129.04 (reached on June 16) would have fetched roughly 7.8 shares; This would have been worth $1,349.58 by Thursday, a return of 35%.

The weekly chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) shows a strong rally off the June 15 bottom, and is now hitting major Fibonacci resistance at both the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels from the recent high and pullback. The next two weeks will be very important to determine how the NASDAQ 100 and other major indices will play out directionally given the earnings, macroeconomic and geopolitical catalysts in the near-term. The price action is showing there is a twin tower candle pattern setup with the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) that is currently flattening out. If the price action finds support at the 20-week SMA in the next few sessions and bounces, then further upside is possible. However, from the opposing perspective, this has all the hallmarks of a traditional harmonic ABCD pattern to the downside. The initial ABCD was made from the recent high to low (Jan. 3 – June 15) which also corresponds to the longer AB leg and a descending wedge pattern. More recently, the price action is within the longer BC leg. If the price action were to reverse, the 200-week SMA (orange line on chart) would act as the first area of support, and if the trend continues thereafter, traders and investors would see a potential move lower. Bitcoin has seen 3 legs lower on the daily time frame since its April highs, where the 200-day SMA acted as strong resistance. As of late the price action has been in a major consolidation phase since mid-June and Friday’s price action saw a large red Maruboza candle off the 20-day SMA which history suggest has an over 80% chance of follow through to the downside. A simple rule of thumb is within a trending market, 3-5 legs are created in the direction of the current trend around 70% of the time before a potential reversal. Taking a peek at the weekly chart, Friday’s price action gave a strong signal for potential further downside as a bearish engulfing candle was made, and broke below both the 200-week SMA. Price is still within the upper 50% of the consolidating range, but a continued breakdown below the 200-week SMA could signal a potential free fall and mass liquidation by institutions. The longer term ABCD pattern to the downside is still intact.","Breaking Down Bitcoin: What Traders Should Watch As BTC Tracks With Nasdaq 100 (QQQ).

The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a modestly higher open on Wall Street on Tuesday. The technology sector led Monday’s sell-off that was triggered by uncertainty around the interest rate outlook. The Nasdaq Composite index slumped 2.55% to 12,381.57, its lowest level since early August. The broader S&P 500 moved down 2.14% to 4,137.99, marking the biggest single-day drop since June 16. The Dow Industrials lost close to 2% before settling at 33,063.61. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield topped 3%, which sent the message that the rate hike cycle isn’t over yet, Ross Gerber, co-founder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management said. Fund manager Louis Navellier said another rate hike is likely in September. This could strengthen the dollar further, attracting foreign capital and pushing Treasury yields lower, he added. At the time of going to press on Tuesday, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow futures were edging up 0.15%, 0.14%, and 0.12%, respectively. The Russel 2000 Index, comprising small-cap stocks, was retreating 0.17%. “If I had to pick a date for the market to explode to the upside, it would be September 21st, because I think there will be a dovish FOMC statement and that the Fed will essentially say they are now neutral and they will remain data-dependent, which means they probably won't raise rates after September 21st,” Navellier said. Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari will make a public appearance after the market closes. The Fed president, who was dovish for the most part of the pandemic, has been adopting a hawkish tone of late. Investors may also focus on the results of the U.S. manufacturing and services sector surveys, both due at 9:45 a.m. ET, and the results of the Philadelphia Fed’s regional manufacturing survey, due at 10 a.m. ET. Also at 10 a.m. ET, the Commerce Department will release its U.S. new homes sales data for July. After a pullback of over 8% in June, new home sales are expected to stabilize and remain flat at the previous month’s level.

Cryptocurrency leaders Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) have mirrored the equities market, each declining more than 10% last week. Exemplifying the market’s downturn is Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), this week’s chart of the week following a disappointing earnings report. Finally, Cboe notes upcoming earnings that may lift investors’ eyebrows in the week to follow. Quick Bites Exchange-Traded Funds The SPDR S&P 500 ETF decreased by 1.16% last week, hinting at a potential top following a strong rally throughout June, July and the first half of August. The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) increased by 2.28% last week, following suit with the SPY’s overall movements. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) rose by 2.85% last week, the highest increase among the three exchange-traded funds recorded in this series.

The Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) decreased by 0.98 % week-on-week. Chart Of The Week: ZM This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Shares of telecommunications company Zoom Video Communications tumbled following an earnings report that surprised Wall Street analysts. On Aug. 22, the company reported an earnings per share (EPS) profit of $1.05, a figure 10% greater than consensus estimates. The positive EPS figure, however, was eclipsed by the company’s revenue miss, which saw it record $1.099 billion instead of the $1.116 billion estimate. The small deviation — amounting to 1.45% — was enough to drive the company’s stock from $97.44 a share to $84.56 on the next day’s open, a 13% decline overnight. Since its height in October 2020, the company’s stock has fallen a whopping 86%. Major Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin decreased by 11.48% last week following weeks of upward momentum. The cryptocurrency remains in a downtrend on the weekly and daily charts. Ethereum decreased by 16.49% last week, completely erasing the week prior’s upward movement.

On Tuesday, the major U.S. averages teased optimism, only to disappoint. After a firmer start, the major indices squandered the advantage and fell sharply in the first hour of trading, consolidating around these lower levels for the rest of the session. The markets were reacting to data showing a slower pace of house price increases and an improvement in consumer confidence. “The goldilocks scenario which underpinned markets for so long have, especially following Jerome Powell’s comments at Jackson Hole, now make positive economic data practically toxic,” LPL Financial’s chief global strategist Quincy Crosby said in a note. All major S&P sectors closed in the red, with energy stocks pacing the declines, reflecting a 5.5% plunge in WTI crude oil prices. Industrials, material, real estate and utility stocks also came under significant selling pressure. With the third straight session of losses, the major averages pulled back to their lowest level in about five weeks.

Although the private payroll numbers from ADP’s survey and the labor department’s non-farm payrolls survey are not always in sync, Wednesday’s data could be taken as an indicative trend for the NFP numbers. Given the recent plunge in crude oil prices, the Energy Information Administration’s weekly crude oil inventories report, due at 10:30 a.m. ET, could create a stir in the energy market. Also in the spotlight are a couple of Fed speeches. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester is scheduled to speak at 8 a.m. ET and Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic would speak on fintech after the market closes. The results of a regional manufacturing survey from the Chicago region are scheduled to be released at 9:45 a.m. ET.

But in the medium term, rates will likely come down again.” The fact that higher rates are expected for now should limit the damage going forward, he added.

Let’s get to the data. Jeffrey Hirsch, the author of ""The Stock Trader’s Almanac,"" uses historical patterns and market seasonality in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis to reduce risk and increase returns for investors. Hirsch took to Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) Thursday to warn investors of the potential dangers of investing during the month of September. “Selling in August before this infamous weak seasonal period is not a new thing,” he said. “August is the second worst month since 1987. We are still in a bear market. Inflation is still high.” Read more: Nvidia, AMD Shares Tumble As US Slaps Export Curbs on Top AI Chips To China: What's At Risk Here?

Speculation aside, September seems to have a peculiar propensity for market catastrophes. The 1929, 1987 and 2008 crashes started in September. The recent global financial crisis was first sparked by Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September 2008. Additionally, options traders appear to believe that future suffering may be worse.

The Last Word: Vaporizing the returns from the nearly nine-week run that gave more than 17% to investors from mid-June to mid-August, many are now wondering whether indices will challenge the June lows after digesting recent hawkish remarks from Fed officials who show no indications of easing off on interest rate hikes. “With history as our guide & current readings tame,” Hirsch said, “we're inclined to heed the seasonal cautions that surround worst month and Weak Spot.

Investors are left to contend with more Fed speeches, while the corporate news flow remains fairly light. On Wednesday, U.S. stocks opened mostly higher and stayed above the unchanged line for the bulk of the session, before closing notably higher. The gains helped the Nasdaq Composite break a seven-session losing streak, the longest since 2016. Some of the positivity could be traced back to the slip back in the U.S. Treasury yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased to 3.265% from 3.34% on Tuesday, apparently as investors priced in a letup in inflationary pressure. That said, Fed officials stuck to their hawkish stance and signaled that more rate hikes could be in the offing. Taking a different stance, Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood warned that the central bank could be making a mistake by acting hastily and aggressively to curb 2-year-long COVID-supply-shock inflation.

It was not to be, though. What Happened: Following a nice rebound that lasted until mid-August, the market has hit another rough patch amid interest rate worries. An analyst now anticipates more pain ahead in the coming months. Stocks could be in for another 20% drop by mid-October, according to Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners. He based his prediction on S&P 500 Price/Earnings multiple historically trending lower when inflation is higher. The annual change in the core price consumption expenditure index is currently at 4.6% and the S&P 500 is currently trading at 19 times. Sharing a graph comparing the historical S&P 500 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio during different inflation environments, Minerd noted that the P/E multiple for a 6%, plus, inflation environment is around 9.1 times, which is more than double that of the 19 times seen currently. Since 1960, P/Es have trended lower when #inflation is higher. With YoY core PCE now at 4.6% and S&P500 trading at ~19x, we should see stocks fall another 20% by mid-October…if historical seasonals mean anything. pic.twitter.com/ZYOgxGXF5e — Scott Minerd (@ScottMinerd) September 8, 2022 See also: 'We Have Not Hit Bottom Yet:' Michael Burry Calls Out Recent Market Crashes — What Could Be Next?

The situation would become graver if earnings began to come down further, he said. He did not rule out the possibility, given the economy ""may very well already be in a recession."" The analyst expects downward pressure on sectors such as energy, which has seen a decline in prices.

"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 14:50:48 -0400",3 Pros On What 8.3% CPI Inflation Number Means For The Fed: 'A Strategic Error Of Epic Proportions',"The Labor Department on Tuesday reported an 8.3% year-over-year increase in the consumer price index for August, which sent the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) spiraling lower. The headline CPI rose 8.3% in August, down from 8.5% in July, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The August CPI reading came in above average economist estimates of 8%. 3 Experts On Inflation Metric: RSM US chief economist Joseph Brusuelas said that any calls for the Fed to pause or pivot are ""premature"" and should be dismissed. Brusuelas noted that global aggregate demand is ""cooling at a troubling pace."" ""Pulling back on the current policy path at the Federal Reserve at this point would be a strategic error of epic proportions,"" he said. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said the August CPI is ""a reminder that we don’t always get what we want."" Tuesday's CPI data represents pricing pain for consumers and pressures for businesses trying to manage through them, he said. ""The Federal Reserve looks at the August CPI and likely remains on track for another large rate hike at the upcoming Sept. meeting."" Hamrick said. Mark Putrino, chief market technician and lead educator at the Benzinga Trading School, wasn't surprised by the release like many so-called Wall Street experts were. Putrino noted that analysts had predicted the CPI data would show a decrease in inflation, which was mostly based on the recent decrease in energy prices. ""But they were looking at the wrong things,"" he said. The increase in inflation should not have come as a surprise for people who understand the market, he said, adding that soaring interest rates are a clear sign of inflationary pressure. Putrino pointed to a 30% yield increase on the 10-year bond in just one month, which he says is an unmistakable sign of inflation. ""The analysts who were surprised by this morning’s CPI release were wrong because they were looking at the wrong part of the market,"" he said. The CPI Report Details: Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up 6.3% in August, above average economist estimates for a 6.1% gain. The Labor Department said gasoline prices fell 10.6% month-over-month in August. Energy prices were down 5%, while food prices climbed 0.8%. The latest CPI inflation data could act as a confirmation of recent indicators for the Fed and signal that another 0.75% rate hike is likely this month.

The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a higher open on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the major U.S. averages recorded their worst single-day declines since the middle of June 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The sell-off, though across-the-board, was more severe among IT and communications services stocks. “Markets hate rate hikes.. and, based on today’s CPI numbers, there is no relief in sight,” Jamie Cox, Managing Partner, Harris Financial Group said. “Even though recent data suggests inflation is coming the Fed’s way, it’s not yet showing up in the data series,” he added.

The year-over-year rates of the headline and core readings were at 7.6% and 9.8%, respectively, in July. Since producer prices are considered a leading indicator of how prices would shape up at the retail level, a softer-than-expected reading could help the market bounce significantly.

On Wednesday, U.S. stocks recovered from the previous session’s steep sell-off and managed to close firmly in the green, partly aided by the producer price inflation report that showed a cool-off in the annual rates of the headline and core wholesale price inflation. Energy stocks skyrocketed after oil’s 1.34% rally on Wednesday, while consumer discretionary and utility stocks also saw notable gains.

The U.S. index futures point to a modestly lower open on Wall Street on Thursday, with the mood reflecting indecision among traders ahead of the key U.S. retail sales report. On Wednesday, U.S. stocks recovered from the previous session’s steep sell-off and managed to close firmly in the green, partly aided by the producer price inflation report that showed a cool-off in the annual rates of the headline and core wholesale price inflation. Energy stocks skyrocketed after oil’s 1.34% rally on Wednesday, while consumer discretionary and utility stocks also saw notable gains. On the other hand, material and real estate stocks served as drags.

Building permits, a leading indicator of housing market activity are expected to see a steeper decline relative to the previous month. The Treasury will restart the sale of 20-year Treasury bonds. The FOMC meets on Tuesday, although its rate decision is not expected until Wednesday. Hedge fund manager Louis Navellier expects the accompanying statement to be dovish. “I am hoping for dovish words like the Fed is 'near parity/neutral' or that it will be 'data dependent' moving forward,” he said in a note. He also hoped that the central bank would raise rates by 25-basis-point increments each in the November and December meetings. In anticipation of a 75-basis-point increase at the September meeting, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has spiked to its highest level since 2011. Stocks In Focus: Ford Motor Co.

It might be prudent to take advantage of the next bounce day to hedge. Let’s look at a way of doing so below. Setting Initial Conditions For the purposes of this example, we’ll assume your portfolio is worth $500,000, and that it’s closely correlated with the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (NYSE:SPY). We’ll also assume you have enough diversification within it to protect against stock-specific risk, and that you can tolerate a decline of up to 20%. If you have a smaller risk tolerance, you can use the same approach entering a smaller decline threshold, Similarly, if you have a larger or smaller portfolio, you can adjust Step 1 below accordingly. If you have gold, bonds, or other asset classes in your portfolio, we’ll address that at the end. Hedging Stock Market Risk Step 1 Divide the dollar value of your portfolio by the current price of SPY. For this example, we’ll use numbers as of Friday’s close, but obviously, you’ll use current data when you do it. SPY closed at $370.53 on Wednesday. Dividing $500,000 by $370.53 gets you 1,349 shares. Step 2 Scan for the optimal, or least expensive, puts to protect against a >20% decline in your number of shares of SPY at the options expiration you want. We’ve selected the January 20th expiration below. It’s far enough out to give you some breathing room, and it’s not too expensive. This and the next screen capture are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app. As you can see above, the number of options contracts the algorithm presented was 13. Since each options contract covers 100 shares, what our algorithm does when you enter a number containing an odd lot like 1,349 is this: it slightly over-hedges the round lots (the 1,300 shares, in this case), so that your entire position, including those extra 49 shares, is protected against the drawdown you specified. Note the cost here: $7,696, or 1.54% of portfolio value. The app calculated that conservatively, using the ask price of the puts (in practice, you can often buy options at some price between the bid and ask prices). Step 3 Round up the number of SPY shares to the nearest 100 and repeat step 2. Note that, in this case, it was cheaper to hedge 1,400 shares using the second hedge, so you would go with that. Hedging Other Asset Classes In our simplified example above, your portfolio was 100% stocks that were highly correlated with SPY. Let’s say your portfolio includes a broader range of asset classes: 40% diversified stocks, 20% tech stocks, 40% bonds. You could use the same approach as above using the Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) as the ticker for the tech stocks, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE:TLT) or the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:LQD) for the bonds (depending if they’re Treasuries or corporates). So, in that case, you’d divide the dollar amount of your tech stocks by the current price of QQQ, etc. ​","Risk Bubbles To The Surface: From The Nord Stream Sabotage, To The Near-Lehman Moment In Britain, Risk Is On The Rise..

The week witnessed see-sawing movement in the market and it remains to be seen if the indices can rally hard to close the week in the green. U.S. stocks opened Thursday’s session lower and fell further in early trading, as traders digested data showing jobless claims falling to a five-month low and second-quarter GDP growing in line with expectations.

"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 08:26:44 -0400",CBOE's Weekly Market Recap: Oct. 3-7,"The market experienced a slight breather last week from the rapid decline that preceded the week prior. Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reports that all the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and indices recorded in this series experienced a price increase last week. France’s Lyxor CAC 40 ETF is the only exception, recording a decline of 4%. The cryptocurrency market has largely mirrored its traditional counterparts, experiencing increases in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) — all of which have experienced very little change over the past three weeks. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released information on nonfarm payrolls in September. The U.S. uses nonfarm payrolls as a measure of the number of workers in the U.S. excluding farm workers and workers considered on the periphery of general economic activity. September’s report saw the U.S. economy add 263,000 nonfarm jobs last month, the least since April of last year but more than consensus estimates of 250,000. The consensus beat was not enough to revive investors’ bullish sentiment; the S&P 500 and other major indices reacted negatively to the news, nearly erasing the three days of positive closes experienced between Oct. 3 and Oct. 5. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) wins chart of the week following a record-shattering delivery announcement that disappointed analysts’ consensus estimates. Wall Street’s eyes and ears will be zoomed in on earning reports this week. Many of these will be centered around America’s largest financial institutions and will provide insight into the state of the economy. Cboe notes the most important earning reports for this week below. Quick Bites Exchange-Traded Funds The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) increased by 1.57% over the previous week. The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) increased by 0.69% over the previous week, mirroring the SPY’s overall movements. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) increased by 2.24% over the previous week. The Cboe Volatility Index™ (INDEXCBOE: VIX) decreased by 0.82% over the previous week. World Markets The iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE:IEUR) increased by 1.11% week-on-week. The iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (LSE: ISF) increased by 1.35% week-on-week. The iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) increased by 1.41% week-on-week. The Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) decreased by 4.18% week-on-week. Chart Of The Week: TSLA This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Shares of Tesla Inc., the world’s most famous electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, declined 10 points overnight — a 4% drop — following news that the company missed analysts’ estimates for car deliveries. Despite delivering 343,830 in the three months to September, a company record, Tesla’s deliveries came 7% short of analysts’ forecasts, a mismatch that sent the company’s stock plummeting. Since the news on Oct. 3, Tesla’s stock has largely continued its downward trajectory, closing at $223 per share and recording a 15% drop in five days. According to some sources, the plummet in Tesla’s stock price speaks to concerns beyond the company’s delivery miss. While shortcomings in delivery estimates could have been pegged to supply-chain issues before, this time they reportedly cannot. The point on investors' minds is the seemingly waning demand for Tesla’s cars. Major Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin increased by 2.07% since the previous week, nearing its yearly low. Ethereum increased by 3.68% since the previous week. Solana increased by 2.71% since the previous week, holding above the key $30 price tag.

He was defeated by former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Here’s a look at how the Nasdaq 100 has performed since Trump left the White House. What Happened: After serving as president for four years, Trump vacated the White House on Jan. 20, 2021. During his time as president, the stock markets enjoyed four years of strong returns. The S&P 500, tacked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), had average annual gains of 14.5% during Trump’s four years in office. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the largest non-financial stocks that trade on the Nasdaq exchange, also enjoyed sizable returns during Trump’s time in office. The Nasdaq 100 is tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). The markets continued to rally after Biden won the presidential election on Nov. 3, 2020 and during his first year as a president. Biden enjoyed the highest one-year market return for the S&P 500 since 1945 when Harry Truman was in the White House. The COVID-19 pandemic, global tensions and a period of high inflation have sent stocks down and erased some of the gains held by investors. Here’s a look at how one of the leading market indexes has performed since Trump left office.

That same investment would be worth $862.71 today, based on a price of $276.52 for QQQ at the time of writing. The investment would be down 13.7% in the 19 months since Trump left office.

"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 07:56:34 -0400",Welcoming Earnings Season – CBOE's Weekly Market Recap: Oct. 10-14,"High levels of uncertainty crept into last week’s market movements, causing whipsawing price action across the board. Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reports that all the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and indices recorded in this series experienced a price decrease last week. Germany’s iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) and France’s Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) were the two exceptions, with both experiencing slight increases in the prior week. The cryptocurrency market has largely mirrored its traditional counterparts, experiencing decreases in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) — all of which have experienced very little change over the past two months. Last month’s consumer price index (CPI) reading exceeded analyst expectations, rising 0.4% in September despite tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Currently, the CPI sits 8.2% higher than a year ago, reflecting inflation’s painful resilience to the Fed’s countermeasures. The market’s reaction to this news was mixed. The S&P 500, for example, plummeted in the aftermarket hours leading to the CPI report. Once the report was released, however, the S&P 500 recovered explosively, rising by 2.64% in one day — only to crash 2.28% on Friday. With uncertainty brimming, Cboe highlights BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) as a chart that may have piqued investor interest following a positive earnings report and a solid reaction to the S&P 500’s bounce. Next week will be huge for the markets, with many of Wall Street’s top firms reporting earnings. Cboe has compiled a list of earnings for investors to keep an eye on at the bottom of this report. Keep scrolling to learn more. Quick Bites Exchange-Traded Funds The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) decreased by 1.42% over the previous week. The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) decreased by 3.11% over the previous week, mirroring the SPY’s overall movements. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) decreased by 1.07% over the previous week. The Cboe Volatility Index™ (INDEXCBOE: VIX) closed at 32 last week, a slight increase over last week’s close at 31.35. World Markets The iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE:IEUR) decreased by 0.55% week-on-week. The iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (LSE: ISF) decreased by 1.81% week-on-week. The iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) increased by 1.24% week-on-week. The Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) increased by 1.16% week-on-week. Chart Of The Week: BLK This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Shares of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, experienced their largest daily increase since the pandemic last week guided by positive movement from the broader market and an earnings report that beat analyst expectations. Just as the S&P 500 completed a 2%-plus upward movement on Oct. 13, BlackRock released an earnings per share (EPS) reading of $9.55 — a 35% positive surprise — and revenue of $4.311 billion, a 2.73% positive surprise. The company’s share price rose by 6.58% that day, gaining 35 points. The presence of large volume at the lows of the chart, without followthrough to the downside, has led many to wonder whether a rally or bottom is forthcoming. U.S. Investing champion Mark Minervini commented on the subject on Twitter saying, “I see people commenting that we made a bottom today. It would be interesting to see the collective long-term performance of these brave prognosticators. There are old traders and bold traders, but not many old, bold traders. I never make bold predictions with my capital.” Major Cryptocurrencies At the time of writing, Bitcoin has decreased by 1.63% since the previous week. It has hovered between $24,000 and $20,000 since the week beginning June 13. At the time of writing, Ethereum has decreased by 2.89% since the previous week. At the time of writing, Solana has decreased by 9.04% since the previous week.

Featured photo by Brendan Church on Unsplash","Welcoming Earnings Season – CBOE's Weekly Market Recap: Oct. 10-14. High levels of uncertainty crept into last week’s market movements, causing whipsawing price action across the board. Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reports that all the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and indices recorded in this series experienced a price decrease last week. Germany’s iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) and France’s Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) were the two exceptions, with both experiencing slight increases in the prior week. The cryptocurrency market has largely mirrored its traditional counterparts, experiencing decreases in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) — all of which have experienced very little change over the past two months. Last month’s consumer price index (CPI) reading exceeded analyst expectations, rising 0.4% in September despite tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Currently, the CPI sits 8.2% higher than a year ago, reflecting inflation’s painful resilience to the Fed’s countermeasures. The market’s reaction to this news was mixed. The S&P 500, for example, plummeted in the aftermarket hours leading to the CPI report. Once the report was released, however, the S&P 500 recovered explosively, rising by 2.64% in one day — only to crash 2.28% on Friday. With uncertainty brimming, Cboe highlights BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) as a chart that may have piqued investor interest following a positive earnings report and a solid reaction to the S&P 500’s bounce. Next week will be huge for the markets, with many of Wall Street’s top firms reporting earnings. Cboe has compiled a list of earnings for investors to keep an eye on at the bottom of this report. Keep scrolling to learn more. Quick Bites Exchange-Traded Funds The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) decreased by 1.42% over the previous week. The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) decreased by 3.11% over the previous week, mirroring the SPY’s overall movements. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:IWM) decreased by 1.07% over the previous week. The Cboe Volatility Index™ (INDEXCBOE: VIX) closed at 32 last week, a slight increase over last week’s close at 31.35. World Markets The iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE:IEUR) decreased by 0.55% week-on-week. The iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (LSE: ISF) decreased by 1.81% week-on-week. The iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) increased by 1.24% week-on-week. The Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) increased by 1.16% week-on-week. Chart Of The Week: BLK This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Shares of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, experienced their largest daily increase since the pandemic last week guided by positive movement from the broader market and an earnings report that beat analyst expectations. Just as the S&P 500 completed a 2%-plus upward movement on Oct. 13, BlackRock released an earnings per share (EPS) reading of $9.55 — a 35% positive surprise — and revenue of $4.311 billion, a 2.73% positive surprise. The company’s share price rose by 6.58% that day, gaining 35 points. The presence of large volume at the lows of the chart, without followthrough to the downside, has led many to wonder whether a rally or bottom is forthcoming. U.S. Investing champion Mark Minervini commented on the subject on Twitter saying, “I see people commenting that we made a bottom today. It would be interesting to see the collective long-term performance of these brave prognosticators. There are old traders and bold traders, but not many old, bold traders. I never make bold predictions with my capital.” Major Cryptocurrencies At the time of writing, Bitcoin has decreased by 1.63% since the previous week. It has hovered between $24,000 and $20,000 since the week beginning June 13. At the time of writing, Ethereum has decreased by 2.89% since the previous week. At the time of writing, Solana has decreased by 9.04% since the previous week.

"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 06:06:53 -0400",Can Apple Weather Industry-Wide Softness And Lift Markets As It Reports Q4 Earnings Today?,"After a few tech earnings disappointments, traders are looking ahead at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is scheduled to release its fiscal year fourth-quarter results on Thursday after the market close. Key Q4 Metrics To Watch Out For: Amid the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, Apple is expected to report low-single-digit earnings per share, or EPS, growth, and mid-single-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is the second busiest season for Cupertino, as it encompasses the key back-to-school season. Q4 Consensus Estimates: EPS: $1.27 Vs. $1.24 a year ago and $1.20 in the preceding quarter Revenue: $88.9 billion Vs $83.36 billion a year ago and $82.96 billion in the preceding quarter The consensus EPS estimate has been trimmed from $1.31 about three months ago to the current number. Recent quarterly performances show that Cupertino beat bottom-line estimates in the previous three quarters and reported in-line results in the quarter ahead of these. “We view this as a seminal print for Apple as the Street gauges the underlying demand for iPhone 14,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a recent note. See Also: Is iPhone Demand Really Slowing Down? Apple Analyst Says This Data Point Proves Otherwise How iPhone, Services Fared? Despite the industry-wide impact of the stronger dollar, Ives expects Apple to hit the Street estimate of $89 billion, thanks to higher ASPs as the mix shifts toward higher-end iPhone models. The analyst said more consumers prefer Pro, swayed by abounding carrier promotions and improved chip/camera technology. BofA Securities' Wamsi Mohan had a different take. In a recent note, the analyst downgraded the stock, citing a weaker iPhone 14 cycle as risk to consumer spending remains elevated globally, especially in Europe. The lead time has been moderating even for the Pro models, he added. Morgan Stanley analyst Eric Woodring predicts 51.1 million iPhone unit shipments for the quarter at an ASP of $838, potentially raking in $43 billion in iPhone revenue. The analyst is also hopeful of iPad and Mac growing above normal seasonality, with iPad revenue likely remaining flat at $8.3 billion from a year ago and Mac revenue growing 14% to $1.04 billion. Gartner's third-quarter PC shipments data released earlier this month showed that Apple was one of the three major vendors, which grew its market share from a year ago. Despite three new compelling September product launches in Watch Series 8, Watch Ultra and AirPods Pro 2, Wearables may have seen a below-seasonal performance, Woodring said. He also expects Services revenue of $19.7 billion, about two points below consensus. Ives, meanwhile, expects the Services segment’s revenue to meet estimates despite challenges on the App Store front. His counterpart at BofA sees a weaker near-term Services trajectory, given the incremental risk of deceleration for App Store and licensing, which account for over 60% of the Services segment. Focal Points Of Earnings Call: Wedbush’s Ives expects Apple to give directional commentary rather than specific guidance for the December quarter. CEO Tim Cook is likely to rave above iPhone 14 Pro's strength, heading into the holiday quarter, he added. Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross said she would look for commentary about demand elasticity. She noted that Apple did not raise iPhone prices in China to retain demand in a market “weighted to flagship models,” but hiked in Japan and Europe. Installment plans available in most geographies would have helped mitigate the impact of price increases, she added. How Apple Trades Around Quarterly Results? The stock gained a little over 2% in the run-up to the company’s third-quarter results announced on July 28. Over the next five sessions following the date, the stock gained an incremental 5.4%. When the company reported its second-quarter results on April 28, the stock was down about 2.2% going into the earnings day and fell about 4.2% over the next five sessions. Apple’s stock fell 4.2% ahead of its first-quarter results released on Jan. 27 but ran up 8.6% following the results. Forward Outlook: For the key holiday selling season, when the company pushes out about one-third of total sales, analysts expect revenue of $128.38 billion, up about 3.6% year-over-year. Most analysts have tempered their expectations for Apple for the fiscal years 2023 as well as 2024, citing a weaker consumer spending backdrop. But one thing working in Apple’s favor would be a 14-week quarter in the fiscal year’s first quarter, Morgan Stanley’s Woodring said. This, according to the analyst, will drive an “acceleration in Y/Y Services revenue growth and sets up the Product business to grow above normal seasonality in the quarter.” Take On Apple Stock: Apple shares have shed roughly 14% year-to-date, which is a more modest decline when compared to the Invesco QQQ Trust’s (NASDAQ:QQQ) 28% drop. The average analysts’ rating for the stock is $183.37, suggesting a roughly 21% upside from current levels, according to data compiled by TipRanks. Technically, Apple shares are currently attempting to break above a resistance area of around $151, which has served as support and resistance levels multiple times since September 2021. If the stock convincingly breaks this barrier, the next resistance lies around the $160 level. On any downside, the $138 area could serve as support.

Read Next: Best Technology Stocks Right Now","Can Apple Weather Industry-Wide Softness And Lift Markets As It Reports Q4 Earnings Today?. After a few tech earnings disappointments, traders are looking ahead at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is scheduled to release its fiscal year fourth-quarter results on Thursday after the market close. Key Q4 Metrics To Watch Out For: Amid the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, Apple is expected to report low-single-digit earnings per share, or EPS, growth, and mid-single-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is the second busiest season for Cupertino, as it encompasses the key back-to-school season. Q4 Consensus Estimates: EPS: $1.27 Vs. $1.24 a year ago and $1.20 in the preceding quarter Revenue: $88.9 billion Vs $83.36 billion a year ago and $82.96 billion in the preceding quarter The consensus EPS estimate has been trimmed from $1.31 about three months ago to the current number. Recent quarterly performances show that Cupertino beat bottom-line estimates in the previous three quarters and reported in-line results in the quarter ahead of these. “We view this as a seminal print for Apple as the Street gauges the underlying demand for iPhone 14,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a recent note. See Also: Is iPhone Demand Really Slowing Down? Apple Analyst Says This Data Point Proves Otherwise How iPhone, Services Fared? Despite the industry-wide impact of the stronger dollar, Ives expects Apple to hit the Street estimate of $89 billion, thanks to higher ASPs as the mix shifts toward higher-end iPhone models. The analyst said more consumers prefer Pro, swayed by abounding carrier promotions and improved chip/camera technology. BofA Securities' Wamsi Mohan had a different take. In a recent note, the analyst downgraded the stock, citing a weaker iPhone 14 cycle as risk to consumer spending remains elevated globally, especially in Europe. The lead time has been moderating even for the Pro models, he added. Morgan Stanley analyst Eric Woodring predicts 51.1 million iPhone unit shipments for the quarter at an ASP of $838, potentially raking in $43 billion in iPhone revenue. The analyst is also hopeful of iPad and Mac growing above normal seasonality, with iPad revenue likely remaining flat at $8.3 billion from a year ago and Mac revenue growing 14% to $1.04 billion. Gartner's third-quarter PC shipments data released earlier this month showed that Apple was one of the three major vendors, which grew its market share from a year ago. Despite three new compelling September product launches in Watch Series 8, Watch Ultra and AirPods Pro 2, Wearables may have seen a below-seasonal performance, Woodring said. He also expects Services revenue of $19.7 billion, about two points below consensus. Ives, meanwhile, expects the Services segment’s revenue to meet estimates despite challenges on the App Store front. His counterpart at BofA sees a weaker near-term Services trajectory, given the incremental risk of deceleration for App Store and licensing, which account for over 60% of the Services segment. Focal Points Of Earnings Call: Wedbush’s Ives expects Apple to give directional commentary rather than specific guidance for the December quarter. CEO Tim Cook is likely to rave above iPhone 14 Pro's strength, heading into the holiday quarter, he added. Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross said she would look for commentary about demand elasticity. She noted that Apple did not raise iPhone prices in China to retain demand in a market “weighted to flagship models,” but hiked in Japan and Europe. Installment plans available in most geographies would have helped mitigate the impact of price increases, she added. How Apple Trades Around Quarterly Results? The stock gained a little over 2% in the run-up to the company’s third-quarter results announced on July 28. Over the next five sessions following the date, the stock gained an incremental 5.4%. When the company reported its second-quarter results on April 28, the stock was down about 2.2% going into the earnings day and fell about 4.2% over the next five sessions. Apple’s stock fell 4.2% ahead of its first-quarter results released on Jan. 27 but ran up 8.6% following the results. Forward Outlook: For the key holiday selling season, when the company pushes out about one-third of total sales, analysts expect revenue of $128.38 billion, up about 3.6% year-over-year.

"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:12:29 -0400","US Market Set To End Week With Whimper As Amazon Drags Nasdaq Futures Lower; Apple, Pinterest, Oil Giants, Inflation Readings In Focus","U.S. index futures are uniformly lower on Friday, as tech stocks continue to drag the overall market. The major U.S. averages closed Thursday’s session on a mixed note, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices declining sharply, while the Dow Industrials bucked the downtrend. While earnings reports from a couple of Dow components propped up the blue-chip average, earnings also proved to be the undoing of the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Traders also reacted to advance third-quarter GDP report, which showed quicker-than-expected growth. “The U.S. is not currently in recession, given the strength of the consumer sector,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial said. Excluding more volatile categories, the growth trajectory looks weak, he added. “A deteriorating housing market and nagging inflation along with an aggressive Federal Reserve put the economy on unsure footing for 2023,” the economist said, adding that the markets have possibly priced in much of the near-term recession risks.

U.S. index futures are uniformly lower on Friday, as tech stocks continue to drag the overall market. The major U.S. averages closed Thursday’s session on a mixed note, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices declining sharply, while the Dow Industrials bucked the downtrend. While earnings reports from a couple of Dow components propped up the blue-chip average, earnings also proved to be the undoing of the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Traders also reacted to advance third-quarter GDP report, which showed quicker-than-expected growth. “The U.S. is not currently in recession, given the strength of the consumer sector,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial said. Excluding more volatile categories, the growth trajectory looks weak, he added. “A deteriorating housing market and nagging inflation along with an aggressive Federal Reserve put the economy on unsure footing for 2023,” the economist said, adding that the markets have possibly priced in much of the near-term recession risks.

A smaller-than-expected 50 basis points hike and a dovish language will lead to the most optimistic outcome, although the analysts see this as the least likely outcome. On Tuesday, the major averages opened higher amid optimism that the Fed will thaw down but weak manufacturing readings proved to be the undoing of the markets.

Trading in the U.S. index futures suggests a mixed start on Wednesday, although the Fed rate decision and the signals coming out from the central bank will ultimately decide which direction the market would take. Contingent on different permutations and combinations, JP Morgan analysts expect the S&P 500 Index to rally over 10% or decline by about 6% to 8% in Wednesday’s session, according to a Bloomberg report. A smaller-than-expected 50 basis points hike and a dovish language will lead to the most optimistic outcome, although the analysts see this as the least likely outcome. On Tuesday, the major averages opened higher amid optimism that the Fed will thaw down but weak manufacturing readings proved to be the undoing of the markets. Stocks pulled back steeply in early trading, moving into negative terrain and then consolidating around these lower levels. Communications, IT and consumer discretionary stocks were among the worst hit but energy stocks found some buying interest.

"Thu, 03 Nov 2022 06:00:30 -0400","Apple Juggernaut Rolls On: iPhone Maker Tops Combined Value Of Facebook, Google Parents And Amazon","Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a standout performer in the September quarter even as several of its tech peers struggled, and it is considered as a recession-proof name. What Happened: Apple’s fundamental performance has helped its stock perform relatively better than other big techs. Apple shares did pull back this year amid the macro uncertainties. The stock is down about 18% year-to-date compared to the nearly 33% slump each by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). See Also: Apple's AR Headset Will Be An Industry Game-Changer, Says Analyst The relative outperformance has helped Apple’s market capitalization push past the combined valuations of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). This was first mentioned by financial YouTuber Joseph Carlson. At Wednesday’s close, Apple’s market cap stood at $2.307 trillion. The market caps of Meta, Amazon and Alphabet were at $240.071 billion, $939.781 billion and $1.126 trillion, respectively, with a cumulative valuation of $2.035852 billion. A comparison with the valuations at the start of the year shows that Apple had a market cap of $2.973 trillion compared to Meta’s $927.94 trillion, Amazon’s $1.735 trillion and Alphabet’s $1.921 trillion. The latter three had a combined valuation of $4.58 trillion at the start of 2022, which was nearly double that of Apple at that point in time. What Makes Apple Tick: Apple’s ability to deliver quarter after quarter is a direct function of its rising installed devices user base. Apple’s sticky ecosystem is able to retain customers as well as grow its user base. CEO Tim Cook said on the fiscal year, fourth-quarter earnings call that the company hit another record on its installed base of active devices, thanks to a quarterly record of upgraders and a double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone. Cook noted particularly strong performances in emerging markets, including India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. The company now has a thriving Services business, which includes revenue from App Store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay and Apple TV+, among other things. The company said it now has 900 million paid subscriptions across services on its platform. Loup Funds’ Gene Munster aptly summarized what Apple offers its investors — “With Apple, the beauty is that investors are buying both performance and potential.” The company, according to the venture capitalist, has growth optionality within three potential addressable markets — health, AR and auto. “One of these three opportunities will likely come to fruition and set up the company for another decade of solid performance,” Munster added. Price Action: Apple closed Wednesday’s session down 3.73% at $145.03, according to Benzinga Pro data.

"Fri, 04 Nov 2022 12:28:34 -0400","How This US Senator, Finance Committee Member Is Betting Against The Stock Market","A U.S. Senator who previously bet against the stock market in 2022 has placed a new bet with an ETF that shorts U.S. listed companies. Here are the details. What Happened: Delaware Senator Thomas Carper bought up to $110,000 in Ranger Equity Bear Bear ETF (ARCA: $HDGE), an active ETF that shorts US listed stocks, according to Unusual Whales, a Twitter account that tracks unusual trades by Congress members. Carper, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, ""is actively shorting the US economy,” Unusual Whales tweeted. Related Link: EXCLUSIVE - Unusual Whales Creates 'Nancy Pelosi ETF' So You Can Track Her Trades The Ranger Equity Bear Bear ETF (NYSE:HDGE) from Advisor Shares was launched in 2011 and has $152 million in assets under management. “The investment objective of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF is capital appreciation through short sales of domestically traded equity securities,” the company’s website says. “In selecting short positions, the Fund seeks to identify securities with low earnings quality or aggressive accounting which may be intended on the part of company management to mask operational deterioration and bolster the reported earnings per share over a short time period.” AdvisorShares says the ETF could be used as a tool in a long/short strategy where investors go long on an index ETF and go long HDGE giving them short exposure as well. The fund invests in companies with future catalysts that could drive stock prices lower. The fund seeks to hold between 20 to 75 short positions averaging in size of 2% to 7% each. Among the current top ten holdings of the ETF are Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED), OneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF), Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH) and Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS). The current makeup of the ETF is 45.7% small cap stocks, 36.5% mid-cap stocks and 17.8% large cap stocks. Why It’s Important: While members of Congress are allowed to buy and sell stocks, including taking short positions, as long as they properly disclose, this could be a bad take for the public. The push to ban members of U.S. Congress from buying and selling stocks, options and ETFs has risen in recent years. Over the last two years, members of Congress have been buying and selling stocks linked to committees they serve on or based on new policies or contracts announced by the U.S. government. Carper, who previously served as Delaware governor from 1993 to 2001, has been a U.S. Senator since 2001. He has actively been betting against the performance of the U.S. stock market in 2022. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Carper could be privy to information of what the U.S. government plans to do to fight high inflation and keep the country out of a recession. Along with the new position in the Ranger Equity Bear Bear ETF, Carper previously held shares of the ProShares Short QQQ (NYSE:PSQ), which bets against the performance of the Nasdaq 100, as tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). Carper also previously held shares of the ProShares Short S&P 500 (NYSE:SH), which shorts the S&P 500, a key market index tracked with the S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). The U.S. Senator holds long positions in several stocks, so the new position could be a hedge as it was meant or a trust that AdvisorShares has found companies that will likely have earnings pressure going forward. News of Carper’s bets against the U.S. stock market could continue to put pressure on a ban of members of Congress to be able to trade stocks. The HDGE ETF is up 7.6% in the last month compared to a 9.2% drop for the S&P 500. The ETF is up 23.0% year-to-date in 2022 compared to a loss of 23.9% for the S&P 500. HDGE beats the S&P 500 over the short term Scaling out further shows HDGE down 22.6% in the last three years compared to a gain of 8.2% for the S&P 500. Over the last five years, HDGE is down 17.6% compared to a gain of 11.7% for the S&P 500.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was rising modestly, although holding below the 4% level. U.S. stocks closed the week ended Nov. 11 with solid gains, thanks to the October inflation print that showed the consumer price index rising at a slower pace of 7.7% compared to September’s 8.2%.

The fund currently owns approximately $40 billion in U.S. assets, out of a total value of $620 billion, according to Bloomberg. The Public Investment Fund’s decision to double down on investment in the tech sector comes at a time when tech stocks are struggling. Invesco’s QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), tracking 100 of the largest and most innovative non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, is down 28% this year, underperforming the S&P 500 by more than 10%.

"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 07:00:46 -0400",US Stocks Hold On To Optimism Even As Putin's Potential Missile Attack On NATO Ally Poland Keeps Investors Cautious — These Stocks In Focus Today,"U.S. stocks could get off to a moderately higher opening, early trading in index futures suggest, as traders load up on stocks in hopes of a Fed pause in the wake of recent inflation data, while developments related to the Russia-Ukraine war keep Investors on edge. The major averages resumed their rally on Tuesday, as stocks rebounded from the declines in the past session. Thanks to a tamer producer price inflation data, the major averages started the session solidly higher and moved sideways until the mid-session. The indices then gave back their gains but recovered to end higher, although off the highs of the session. Most sectors, with the exception of healthcare and material stocks, advanced. Technology, consumer, energy, utility and real estate stocks all ended solidly higher. U.S. Indices' Performance On Tuesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite +1.45% 11,358.41 S&P 500 Index +0.87% 3,991.73 Dow Industrials +0.17% 33,592.92 The slowdown in inflation is a signal and may not be a trend, Daniel Berkowitz, senior investment officer at Prudent Management Associates, said. With the Fed telegraphing that they are looking for several months of moderating price levels at a minimum, the analysts said despite the encouraging October consumer and producer price indices, these “metrics still bear careful monitoring moving forward before firm conclusions are drawn about inflation’s future path. “Net, net inflation and interest risk remain skewed to the downside in our assessment,” the analyst said. “Despite the downward pressure on Treasury yields, the yield curve remains highly inverted beyond short-term maturities, providing limited compensation for taking material duration risk.” Here’s a peek into index futures trading: U.S. Futures' Performance On Wednesday During Premarket Session Index Performance (+/-) Nasdaq 100 Futures +0.06% S&P 500 Futures +0.16% Dow Futures +0.14% R2K Futures +0.18% In premarket trading on Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) moved up 0.34% to $399.85 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) rose 0.33% to $290.35, according to Benzinga Pro data.

But there is no question some investments performed better than others along the way. Tech's Bumpy Ride: While the stock market has been extremely strong since it bottomed on March 23, 2020, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) has cooled off significantly since mid-2021. The QQQ ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In Energy Transfer (ET) Stock At Its COVID-19 Pandemic Low, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Pandemic Sell-Off: The QQQ fund started 2020 on a high note, rising from around $215 to start the year to a pre-pandemic high of $237.47 in mid-February. Unfortunately, over the next several weeks, the bottom completely fell out of the market thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. The QQQ ETF plummeted as low as $165 on March 23, 2020, the same day the S&P 500 bottomed. At the time, investors had no idea March 23 would mark the end of the shortest bear market in U.S. history, at just 33 days in duration. By April 7, the QQQ was back above $200. By June 4, the fund was back at new all-time highs, but the rally certainly didn’t stop there. The combination of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, unprecedented government stimulus measures, a virus mortality rate that was much better than initially feared and a handful of effective vaccines sent growth stock prices skyrocketing well above pre-pandemic levels. Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In Verizon (VZ) Stock At Its COVID-19 Pandemic Low, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Limping Into 2023: Two brief tech stock sell-offs in September and October of 2020 were mere bumps in the road for the QQQ on its march to all-time highs of $408.71 in November 2021. Unfortunately, concerns about inflation and aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes in 2022 drove the QQQ fund all the way back down to as low as $254.26 in October 2022. The fund has since rebounded to $284.82. Investors who bought the QQQ fund at its pandemic low and held on to today have now underperformed the total return of the SPY in that time. In fact, $1,000 in the QQQ ETF bought on March 23, 2020, would be worth about $1,695 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, the fate of QQQ investors rests largely in the hands of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Together, those two tech behemoths represent a combined 23.7% of the QQQ’s total assets.

"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 09:23:04 -0400",CBOE's Weekly Market Recap: Nov.14-18 – Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Captures Investors' Attention,"The market has experienced some relief from bearish price action in November, continuing October’s push to usher the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) toward $400. Individual stocks have seen some relief as well, particularly in the oil & gas, biotechnology and financial sectors, which continue to show bullish action compared to the general market. The current rally is likely influenced by the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports, both of which came in below expectations. This arguably indicates that the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening policies are starting to work. Cboe Global Markets Inc. (BATS:CBOE) reports that all the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and indices recorded in this series experienced a price decrease last week as the general market experienced a pullback in its short-term uptrend. Britain’s iShares Core DAX UCITS ETF (BIT: EXS1) and France’s Lyxor CAC 40 ETF (EPA: CAC) were the two exceptions, both experiencing slight increases in the prior week. The cryptocurrency market has largely mirrored its traditional counterparts, experiencing decreases in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) — all of which have dropped in value following FTX’s collapse. With uncertainty brimming, Cboe highlights Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) as a chart that may have piqued investor interest following positive clinical trial results for their new Alzheimer’s drug. Next week will be huge for the fashion retail sector, with many of Wall Street’s top firms reporting earnings. Cboe has compiled a list of earnings for investors to keep an eye on at the bottom of this report. Keep scrolling to learn more.

Chart Of The Week: BIIB This photo was taken from the TradingView platform Shares of Biogen skyrocketed on Sept. 22nd after the company announced positive clinical trial results for their Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab. The company said their drug met all key secondary endpoints with highly statistically significant results. These results have brought Biogen closer to a Federal Drug Agency (FDA) approved Alzheimer’s drug, a feat several biopharmaceutical companies are competing to achieve. Investors responded enthusiastically to this information. Biogen’s trading volume on the 28th of September hit 7.111 million shares, a 1,500% positive deviation off of the 50-day average trading volume of 331,000. The stock’s price slingshotted 50% overnight – rising to $284 a share – and, since then, has drifted toward $300.

The index futures are pointing to a modestly higher opening on Friday. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note has pulled back sharply to a seven-week low on Friday in reaction to the dovish message relayed by the minutes. The major averages advanced on Wednesday as investors construed the FOMC minutes as hinting at a slowdown in the pace of fed funds rate hikes. The Dow Industrials and the S&P 500 Index closed at their highest levels in about three months. Wall Street remained closed on Thursday in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday.

Commodities, Other Global Markets: Crude oil futures are rebounding strongly following the 4.66% plunge on Wednesday. A barrel of WTI-grade crude oil traded at $79.69, up 2.25%. The spike comes amid the meeting between energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iraq on Thursday, in which they discussed the need to adhere to the OPEC+ output cut that lasts until the end of 2023, Reuters reported. Asia-Pacific stocks closed a lackluster session on Friday on a mixed note amid a lack of cues from Wall Street overnight. After the markets closed, the People’s Bank of China announced a cut in the reserve requirement for banks by 25 basis points, effective Dec. 5, Reuters said. The reserve requirement was cut by a similar magnitude in April. This will likely help boost liquidity in the system as the country struggles with a renewed spike in COVID-19 cases.

"Thu, 01 Dec 2022 10:08:05 -0400",The Federal Reserve's Preferred Inflation Data Just Cooled And Risk Assets Are Flying: What's The Fed's Next Move?,"The SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) is on the rise Thursday morning after the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported a 6% increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index in October. What Happened: The headline PCE came in at 6% for October, down from 6.2% in September. The number was in line with average economist estimates, according to Benzinga Pro. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up 5% in September, in line with average economist estimates. In other economic news, jobless claims decreased by 16,000 for the week ending Nov. 26 to 225,000 from an upwardly revised level of 241,000 in the prior week, according to data the Labor Department released on Thursday. The number came in below average economist estimates of 235,000. Continuing claims jumped to 1.608 million in the week ended Nov. 19, marking the highest levels since February. The number was up 57,000 from the previous week's revised level. Why It Matters: The Fed's preferred inflation measure appears to be showing signs of cooling following an aggressive series of four consecutive 0.75% rate hikes. Most expect the Fed to opt for a smaller 0.5% rate increase at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 14. Thursday's data appears to be a step in the right direction if the market's moves is any indication. Assets that tend to move with rates immediately started to pop, with gold prices rising in the immediate aftermath, while Nasdaq (NASDAQ:QQQ) and S&P futures also moving higher. At the central bank's last meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there is still significant uncertainty around the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to its 2% goal. Powell provided additional insight during a Brookings Institution speech on Wednesday, suggesting the Fed may begin slowing the pace of rate hikes as soon as this month. The Fed will get to see several new data sets over the next two weeks before it makes its decision, beginning with Friday's payroll report. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 200,000 jobs in November after rising by 261,000 in October, per Reuters.

With the Federal Reserve signaling its intention to potentially pivot, each incoming data is likely to trigger volatility in the market. On Thursday, the major U.S. averages closed on a mixed note, as traders reacted to economic reports showing a slight letup in inflationary pressure and weakening economic activity. Some of the weakness may be traced back to profit-taking following Wednesday’s strong rally, which took the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite indices to their highest level since mid-September. Financial and real estate stocks were among the worst-hit sectors on Thursday, while tech stocks gained ground.

Economists, on average, expect the economy to have added 200,000 jobs during the month, according to data compiled by Benzinga Pro. This marks a slowdown from the pace of hiring seen in October when the economy added 261,000 jobs. The November estimate, though pointing to a slowdown, is still above a sustainable pace, Credit Suisse economists said in a weekly note. That said, the ongoing slowdown will likely encourage the Fed as it plans to ease up on its pace of rate hikes at the December meeting, they added. The November Federal Open Market Committee meeting’s post-meeting policy statement and minutes as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Wednesday were construed by traders as a shift in the central bank’s hawkish stance. Private sector job gains are estimated at 190,000, also slowing from 233,000 additions in the previous month. Demand for temporary staff during the holiday season is likely to have boosted part-time employment. The results of Challenger, Gray & Christmas’ November survey released on Thursday showed that U.S. firms laid off 76,835 jobs in November, with the bulk of it in the technology sector. This marked a 417% jump. from a year ago and a 127% increase from October. Big techs, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), have drastically cut jobs to grow bottom-line amid the uncertainties that are weighing down on the top line. The consensus expectation is for the unemployment rate, based on the household survey, to remain stayed put at 3.7% in November. Average hourly earnings – an inflation gauge, may have grown at a slower month-over-month pace of 0.3% compared to 0.4% growth in October. “This is still an uncomfortably strong pace of wage growth for the Fed, but it’s approaching levels that may be consistent with a return to the 2.0% inflation target,” Credit Suisse said. The annual rate of the metric is expected to ease from 4.7% to 4.8%. The FOMC is set to meet for its final monetary policy meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14, and market participants and analysts alike hope for the Fed to at least slow down the pace of its rate increases. From near-zero levels before March, the fed funds rate has been increased by a cumulative 3.75% percentage points to 3.75%-4%.

"Mon, 05 Dec 2022 09:03:07 -0400",Morgan Stanley Analyst Reverses 'Tactical Recovery' Call And Turns Seller Of Stocks: Here's Why,"Even as the market showed some signs of resurgence as it entered one of its seasonally strong periods, one analyst is not that optimistic about a reversal in sentiment. What Happened: Morgan Stanley is a seller again, analysts led by strategists Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients, reported Bloomberg. The analysts have called for a resumption of the downtrend close on the heels of the S&P 500 Index breaking above its 200-day moving after a seven-month hiatus. The downtrend that began at the start of the year is still intact, the analysts said. “This makes the risk-reward of playing for more upside quite poor at this point,” they added. See Also: Best Penny Stocks This is a reversal in stance by Wilson, who said last week the “tactical recovery” could continue into December. He had then said, renewed selling would emerge in the new year, dragged by weak corporate earnings. He sees the S&P 500 Index climbing just about 2% from current levels to 4,150 over the next week or so. Stay Invested In Defensives: Against this backdrop, the strategist recommended sticking to a defensive posture and preferring healthcare, utility and consumer staple stocks. Growth stocks, which typically benefit from lower rates, could be held down in 2023 due to the risk to corporate profit growth. Tech stocks have underperformed this year, as is evident from the 26% plunge year-to-date compared to the more modest 14% drop by the S&P 500 Index. Big techs such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) are down 63%, 44% and 31%, respectively, this year. Even the fairly resilient Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has lost 16% year-to-date. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 Index, fell 0.21% to $291.93 in premarket trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.

He didn’t do that because he knows we’re making progress,” Cramer said.

The sell-off in the space was so indiscriminate that most shed billions or millions from their market capitalizations. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has lost almost twice as much as the broader S&P 500 Index, underlining the skewed nature of the market sell-off toward the tech space. Falling Off The Cliff: The economy did have a part in the tech meltdown, but it alone cannot be squarely blamed. Tech stocks were on an extended run between 2016 and 2021, pushing valuations of many equities to unsustainable levels, Christopher Baggini, global head of equity strategy of JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management, said in a note. See Also: Best Technology Stocks Right Now These valuations, according to the analyst, could not be sustained in a higher interest rate environment. The situation got worse with the “complicated dynamics of slowing economic growth, uneven demand, inventory management and gradually improving supply chains,” he said. For taking stock of the ravages, we don’t have to look past the big techs, which now look like a pale shadow of their old selves. The FAANG stocks, save Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are down by much more than the Nasdaq Composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 Index. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has the worst loss for the year so far in this category, followed by Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Apple also has had its fair share of problems, especially with the concentration of its production base in China hurting output and shipments. Source: Proprietary chart It was against this backdrop that these companies began shifting their focus on operational discipline in a bid to preserve margins. The result: thousands of employees taken off payrolls, cost cuts, projects shelved and unprofitable divisions shut down. Meta for one announced massive layoffs numbering 11,000 in November. When Elon Musk took Twitter private, he planned a three-quarter reduction in payrolls. Future Is Tense: Despite the extremely attractive valuations, not many analysts agree that a reversal is around the corner. Macroeconomic headwinds could prove to be a pushback for the sector, as circumspect consumers abstain from huge purchases. The Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell has signaled that rate hikes could continue well into 2023, albeit at a slower pace. This has a direct bearing on consumer spending. Inflationary pressure, though abating, still runs high, leaving consumers with less real income to splurge on consumer discretionary items. Tech supply chains still remain constrained amid adverse geopolitical challenges. China is being hit by one COVID-19 wave after another, leading to production disruptions at big U.S. tech companies such as Apple, which are heavily reliant on the country. To make matters worse, competitive pressure is intensifying, hurting revenues. A case in point is TikTok, which has been blamed for part of the weaknesses at most other communication tech companies. Even amid all these dark clouds, there are a few silver linings. 4 Themes Supportive Of Tech Stocks: 1. Potential Easing Of Dollar Strength: Most technology companies, especially big techs, conduct businesses globally and derive a substantial portion of their revenue in local currencies. As the dollar continued to rise against other major currencies amid the Fed’s aggressive tightening, it shaved some percentage points off topline growth. Forex volatility is a headwind for big techs, which have 35%-40% revenue exposure to Europe, and a stronger dollar is a 400-basis-point top-line headwind, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, Axios reported. With the Fed expected to slow down the pace of rate hikes or even pause in the new year, analysts see the greenback weakening in 2023. This should remove one of the overhangs around the tech space. 2. M&A, Consolidation: Valuations of tech companies are below the past five-year averages, Ives said in a recent note. This, the analyst said, could lead to a spate of M&A transactions in the space in 2023. The M&A wave has already begun. Tech-focused privateequity firm Thoma Bravo announced earlier this month a deal to buy Coupa Software Inc. (NASDAQ:COUP). 3. Lean, Mean Structures: Industry veterans and analysts blame much of the current predicament on the excesses of tech companies, which bloated their cost structures. From irrational exuberance, companies are now coming to terms with the stark reality, and this has forced them to announce massive layoffs and rethink priorities. Most have begun focusing on a smaller number of high-priority growth areas, JPMorgan analysts said in a recent commentary. The analysts pointed to Amazon’s flexibility in pushing first-party versus third-party inventory and its Prime offering, Alphabet’s focus on diversifying its revenue streams by developing its non-ad business and Meta leaning toward its AI discovery engine, ad and business platforms as well as its multiyear transition to the metaverse. Source: JPMorgan “Overall, key opportunities for Big Tech in 2023 include rightsizing cost structures through headcount reduction and greater operating discipline, increasing focus on profits and cash flow, leaning responsibly into new growth drivers and gaining market share during this tough macro period,” JPMorgan’s tech analyst Doug Anmuth said. 4. Supportive Valuations: Big techs alone have lost a combined market cap of $2.5 trillion in 2022, JPMorgan estimates. Source: TradingView The oversold levels typically suggest a rebound may be around the corner. This time around, the upcoming year is fraught with risks. Consumer tech companies could face the brunt of negativity as COVID-19 tailwinds abate, energy prices rise in Europe and global economic activity slows, Franklin Templeton said in its 2023 technology sector outlook.

"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 17:11:05 -0400","What Are The Returns From $1,000 Invested In Apple, Doge, SPY If The Assets Reclaim 2022 Highs?","A tough year marred by macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions is drawing to a close. Most financial assets, including stocks, bonds and cryptos, have come off notably from the levels at which they started 2022. Here’s a look at what drove the performance of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the tech bellwether; Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), a widely followed crypto; and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the broader market gauge, and the returns each would generate if the tide turns. Apple Not Recession-Proof: As the year started, analysts touted Apple as one company that can weather any potential downturn. They had pinned their hopes on Apple’s sticky ecosystem and the thinking that the company’s customers could be relatively insensitive to the vagaries of the economy. Apple’s troubles started with production issues in China. As COVID-19 forced the closure of the main iPhone factory of supplier Hon Hai Precision Manufacturing Company Limited (OTC:HNHPF), Cupertino came out with a warning that production of its high-end iPhone Pro will be impacted. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring recently lowered his December quarter iPhone unit shipment estimate as well as his company-wide revenue and earnings per share estimates. More worrisome: the analyst does not see any of the demand deferring to the March quarter. So, it could be demand lost rather than demand deferred. Apple trades in a 52-week range of $129.04-$182.94. See also: How to Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Doge Whimpers: Doge rose to an all-time high of $0.737567 in May 2021, with the chief upside catalyst being Tesla CEO Elon Musk talking up the meme currency. His mentions were enough to spark a rally in the crypto. Incidentally, Doge peaked well before the overall crypto market did in November 2021. Come 2022, all the cryptos, including the Doge, headed southward amid increasing risk aversion. Macro challenges and industry-specific triggers such as issues with major cryptos and cryptocurrency exchanges dragged the onetime high-fliers. Doge trades in a 52-week range of $0.049720-$0.203232 and has lost about 56% year-to-date. SPY's Relative Outperformance: The SPY, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index, has fared better than most other asset classes. The ETF’s year-to-date move is a negative 18.07% compared to a 25.3% downward move by Apple and the 32.3% pullback by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), a tech-heavy ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index. The reason for the outperformance is obvious. The index comprises large-cap stocks belonging to diverse sectors, while the NDX and the QQQ are made up of large-cap, non-financial tech companies. The sell-off this year has been led by the tech sector. The SPY traded in a 52-week range of $348.11-$479.98. How Returns Compare: A $1,000 invested at Apple’s current stock price of $132.23 will fetch 7.6 shares. If the stock retests the 52-week high of $182.94 (Jan. 4 intraday high), the same shares would be worth $1,383.5, a return of 38.35%. A $1,000 invested in Doge at its current price of $0.075673 will fetch 13,214.8 coins. If the 52-week of $0.20232 (Jan. 14 intraday high) is reclaimed, the holding’s value would increase to $2,673.6, a return of 167.4%. A $1,000 invested in SPY at current levels will fetch 2.61 units and if the ETF climbs back to its 52-week high of $479.98 (Jan. 4 intraday high), the value of the units would increase to $1,252.8. This would translate to a return of 25.3%.

A tough year marred by macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions is drawing to a close. Most financial assets, including stocks, bonds and cryptos, have come off notably from the levels at which they started 2022. Here’s a look at what drove the performance of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the tech bellwether; Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), a widely followed crypto; and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the broader market gauge, and the returns each would generate if the tide turns. Apple Not Recession-Proof: As the year started, analysts touted Apple as one company that can weather any potential downturn. They had pinned their hopes on Apple’s sticky ecosystem and the thinking that the company’s customers could be relatively insensitive to the vagaries of the economy. Apple’s troubles started with production issues in China. As COVID-19 forced the closure of the main iPhone factory of supplier Hon Hai Precision Manufacturing Company Limited (OTC:HNHPF), Cupertino came out with a warning that production of its high-end iPhone Pro will be impacted. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring recently lowered his December quarter iPhone unit shipment estimate as well as his company-wide revenue and earnings per share estimates. More worrisome: the analyst does not see any of the demand deferring to the March quarter. So, it could be demand lost rather than demand deferred. Apple trades in a 52-week range of $129.04-$182.94. See also: How to Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Doge Whimpers: Doge rose to an all-time high of $0.737567 in May 2021, with the chief upside catalyst being Tesla CEO Elon Musk talking up the meme currency. His mentions were enough to spark a rally in the crypto. Incidentally, Doge peaked well before the overall crypto market did in November 2021. Come 2022, all the cryptos, including the Doge, headed southward amid increasing risk aversion. Macro challenges and industry-specific triggers such as issues with major cryptos and cryptocurrency exchanges dragged the onetime high-fliers. Doge trades in a 52-week range of $0.049720-$0.203232 and has lost about 56% year-to-date. SPY's Relative Outperformance: The SPY, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index, has fared better than most other asset classes. The ETF’s year-to-date move is a negative 18.07% compared to a 25.3% downward move by Apple and the 32.3% pullback by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), a tech-heavy ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index. The reason for the outperformance is obvious. The index comprises large-cap stocks belonging to diverse sectors, while the NDX and the QQQ are made up of large-cap, non-financial tech companies. The sell-off this year has been led by the tech sector. The SPY traded in a 52-week range of $348.11-$479.98. How Returns Compare: A $1,000 invested at Apple’s current stock price of $132.23 will fetch 7.6 shares. If the stock retests the 52-week high of $182.94 (Jan. 4 intraday high), the same shares would be worth $1,383.5, a return of 38.35%. A $1,000 invested in Doge at its current price of $0.075673 will fetch 13,214.8 coins. If the 52-week of $0.20232 (Jan. 14 intraday high) is reclaimed, the holding’s value would increase to $2,673.6, a return of 167.4%. A $1,000 invested in SPY at current levels will fetch 2.61 units and if the ETF climbs back to its 52-week high of $479.98 (Jan. 4 intraday high), the value of the units would increase to $1,252.8. This would translate to a return of 25.3%.
