"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 18:46:19 -0400",3 Classic Tech ETFs to be Tested by Earnings Reports This Week,"Earnings seasons is chugging along and this week brings mammoth tests for the high-flying communication services and technology sectors. Consider this week of “not fooling around” earnings reports because technology and communication services stocks combine for about 34.60% of the S&P 500's weight. Here's the run down of big name technology and communication services stocks reporting earnings this week: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivers results on Jan. 28. The following day, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) report. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reports on Jan. 30. And while Feb. 3 is next week, that date is worth remembering because that's when Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) steps into the earnings confessional. Here are some exchange traded funds that will be in the earnings spotlight over the next several days. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) After a monster year in 2019, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) is off to a stellar start in 2020 with a gain of 6.3%. That will be tested this week because XLK, the largest tech ETF by assets, will be under earnings scrutiny in significant fashion. Apple and Microsoft combine for nearly 40% of this fund's weight, exposure to those names that's comparable among other cap-weighted tech ETFs. And don't forget that Visa (NYSE:V), 5.33% of XLK's roster, also reports later this week. Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLC) is the oldest and largest ETF dedicated to this sector. More importantly, its the ETF with the largest Facebook weight as the social media giant accounts for almost 20% of XLC's roster, according to issuer data. As noted earlier, Alphabet reports earnings next week and the GOOG and GOOGL classes of that stock combine for 23.5% of XLC's roster. However, there's more to consider this week with XLC as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), a combined 8.40% of the fund's weight, also report earnings. Invesco QQQ (QQQ) The Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) makes for a predictable ETF to consider over the next few days because it devotes 69% of its weight to technology and communication services stocks. Apple and Microsoft combine for nearly 23% of QQQ's weight while Amazon, Facebook and Google and combine for another 20.60%.","3 Classic Tech ETFs to be Tested by Earnings Reports This Week.

"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 08:39:00 -0400",3 Microsoft-Heavy ETFs To Watch Ahead Of Earnings,"In what will be a brisk week of earnings reports from the always widely watched technology sector, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the names stepping into the earnings confessional. The Dow component, one of the blue-chip index's best-performing constituents dating back to the start of 2019, reports on Wednesday. Investors looking to access the software giant via exchange traded funds often turn to the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) and the Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ). At a weight north of 19%, XLK has the largest Microsoft allocation among all ETFs. QQQ, the Nasdaq 100-tracking ETF, is another favored ETF for Microsoft exposure because of its nearly 11% allocation to the stock. For investors looking for other ETF avenues to the high-flying stock, consider the following offerings. See Also: 3 Classic Tech ETFs to be Tested by Earnings Reports This Week Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC) For investors looking to make a long-term commitment to the technology sector with an ETF, the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (NYSE:FTEC) is a great way to go because its 0.084% fee is the lowest among tech all ETFs in this category. Just three ETFs, including the aforementioned XLK, have larger Microsoft weights than does FTEC. Beyond FTEC's utility as a Micorsoft proxy, the Fidelity fund has other perks, including exposure to the oft-discussed 5G rollout. “As 5G networks are being built around the world, the network infrastructure and equipment providers, as well as the semiconductor companies that supply them, should benefit most in the near term,” Fidelity said in a recent note. “Once the network reaches critical mass, companies further down the value chain will likely see more benefit: Service providers, handset and other hardware makers (and the semiconductor companies that supply to them), and ultimately providers of applications and software.” iShares Evolved U.S. Technology ETF (IETC) The iShares Evolved U.S. Technology ETF (CBOE:IETC) is an actively managed fund designed to deliver a refreshed approach to technology stocks, but that doesn't mean abandoning mature names like Microsoft. In fact, IETC holds 236 stocks, many of which are older tech fare. That includes the fund's 15.50% Microsoft weight, by far the largest on the IETC roster. IETC is up 6% to start 2020. Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO) Microsoft is indeed a momentum stock, garnering it a place in the Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (NYSE:SPMO). SPMO follows the S&P 500 Momentum Index, which is comprised of S&P 500 members with favorable momentum traits. Not surprisingly, that gives the fund an almost 32% weight to tech and Microsoft is its largest holding at 10.15%, or 300 basis points more than the fund's second-largest holding.","3 Microsoft-Heavy ETFs To Watch Ahead Of Earnings.

As the spread of the COVID-19 virus continues to evolve, many travelers have been reconsidering their plans and the best way to prepare and protect themselves from exposure to the virus. In reaction to this, many airline, casino and hotel stocks have taken a huge hit. With many people staying home, either out of self-imposed quarantines or because of government requirements, sales at movie theaters, retail stores and restaurants are poised to suffer. Casino Operators In Macau, the Chinese territory and the world’s biggest gambling hub, casino operators closed for two weeks in February to help curb the spread of the virus. Wynn Resorts, Ltd. (NASDAQ:WYNN) shares were down slightly at $107.94 at the close Monday. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (NASDAQ:MLCO) shares were down 1.15% at $17.14. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) shares gained 2%, ending the session at $25.05. Cruise Liners The Carnival Cruise (NYSE:CCL)-owned Diamond Princess was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arrival in Yokohama, Japan Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. The shares of a number cruise companies have also been trading lower as the COVID-19 spread continues to negatively impact travel stocks. Carnival shares were down 1.2% at $33.06 at the close Monday. Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) shares were up 0.09% at $80.48 at the close Monday. The stock has a 52-week high of $133.60 and a 52-week low of $89.48. Norwegian Cruise Line (NASDAQ:NCLH) shares were down 4.48% at $35.59 on Monday. The stock has a 52-week high of $59.71 and a 52-week low of $39.36. Medical Devices A number of medical device stocks are benefitting from the outbreak. Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CODX) shares ended Monday's session 34.62% higher at $17.81 after the company announced it will provide COVID-19 tests to U.S. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, labs. Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. (NYSE:APT) manufactures masks and protective apparel, goods that are already in high demand in China. Bulk orders are expected as the disease progresses. The stock traded sharply higher after the company said Feb. 27 it expects to fulfill the remainder of $14.1 million in booked orders for face masks by the end of the second quarter as demand rises due to the COVID-19 virus spreading in the second quarter. Global Corporations Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have collectively lost $238 billion in market cap, CNBC reported Feb. 27. The companies are the five most valuable in the U.S. by market cap. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) reaffirmed its full-year 2020 guidance Feb. 21 and estimated the impact the coronavirus outbreak will have on its first quarter. The company said it has enacted precautionary measures for employees in China such as providing face masks and hand sanitizers, installing temperature screening at its facilities and setting up health monitoring systems across its Chinese operations. Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) Most of the athleisure retailer's 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3 and some are reopened on a reduce schedule, Luluemon said in a Feb. 21 press release. The company’s online business has continued to operate. Commodities Plunge The prices of almost all commodities plunged amid fears the coronavirus is morphing into a pandemic, with negative implications for global economic activity and commodities demand, said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. “Prior to the virus outbreak, we had expected a gradual pick-up in global growth to support most commodities prices. This week, we revised our metals forecasts to reflect our more bearish view on the outlook for China,"" Bain said in a note. ""In the next few weeks, as the global impact becomes clearer, we expect to revise our energy and precious metals forecasts."" If OPEC+ decided to deepen output cuts at meetings scheduled for March 5-6, there could be some respite for oil prices, she said. ""The chances of further output cuts have increased in the last week or so as the virus has spread rapidly outside China. That said, given the scale of risk aversion in financial markets, any OPEC+ action is more likely to stem further falls in oil prices rather than give them a lift."" ETF Activity ETF short selling has been highly active in the last two weeks during the broader market slowdown, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said in a note. “We track short selling activity in over 2,500 domestically traded ETFs with short interest of $161 billion,” he said. “Over the last two weeks we saw +$6.2 billion of additional net short selling in ETFs, an increase of just over +4.0%. The mega-shorts in the ETF sector held their spots in the ETF league tables, with the top seven most shorted ETFs holding onto their positions. But spots 8 to 20 saw a lot of movement as short sellers adjusted their hedges and looked for Alpha in different sectors.” The largest increase in ETF short selling occurred in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), as the biggest portfolio hedge got even bigger with $3.6 billion in short selling over the last two weeks, he said. The PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) and iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWM) had $328 million in short covering as portfolio hedgers and short sellers seeking alpha looked toward the larger-cap S&P 500 instead of the tech-heavy Nasdaq and broader market Russell 2000, Dusaniwsky said.

"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 16:11:37 -0400",4 Bearish ETFs Just Right For A Wild Market With Coronavirus Volatility,"Friday brought an upbeat February jobs report, but confirming that market participants are locked into the coronavirus, stocks continued swooning as the number of confirmed cases of the respiratory illness in the U.S. ballooned past 230. With major equity benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average residing below key trendlines, including the 200-day moving average, conditions are ideal for active traders to consider inverse and leveraged bearish exchange traded funds. Here are a few names traders can consider if market conditions continue deteriorating over the near-term. ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) The ProShares Short QQQ (NYSE:PSQ) is an ideal way for even conservative traders to participate in downside for technology and communication services stocks: this fund is inverse, though not leveraged. What that means is that PSQ is designed to deliver the daily inverse performance of the popular Nasdaq-100 Index. So if that benchmark declines by 1% on a given day, PSQ should rise by 1%. PSQ is also a good short-term hedge for investors holding the Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ), the Nasdaq-100 tracking ETF. Although PSQ isn't leveraged, those using it should still treat as a short-term instrument. “Due to the compounding of daily returns, holding periods of greater than one day can result in returns that are significantly different than the target return and ProShares' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the target return for the same period ,” according to ProShares. Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X Shares (ERY) Friday's more than 15% jump, one built on heavy volume, by the Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:ERY) notwithstanding, it's easy to see why ERY is an alluring short-term play in the current environment. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said earlier this week it's cutting output, and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) laid out budgets that indicate a large amount of prudence. Yet energy stocks are trading as if oil is at $20 per barrel, not the $43 area where it actually resides. ERY aims to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of the Energy Select Sector Index, and the risk with this fund is clear: ERY has already more than doubled this year, and with the energy sector so battered, it may not take much after the coronavirus situation ebbs to ignite a rally here, punishing ERY in the process. Direxion Daily Consumer Discretionary Bear 3X Shares (PASS) Although the February jobs report would appear to indicate the U.S. economy remains on solid footing, it encompasses a period in which the coronavirus only started becoming a concern in the U.S. Now, it's a breakout — and one that could easily derail consumer confidence. Look at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is lower by more than 8% this month. Amazon is relevant to the Direxion Daily Consumer Discretionary Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:PASS) because PASS's underlying index devotes over 23% of its weight to the e-commerce giant. ProShares Ultra Short Industrials (SIJ) The coronavirus is punishing the industrial sector, as highlighted by recently sour performances by Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), just to name two. Enter the ProShares Ultra Short Industrials (NYSE:SIJ), which tries to deliver double the daily inverse returns of the Dow Jones U.S. Industrials Index. Looking at the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLI), a near-term case grows for SIJ. XLI is sporting a March loss approaching 14% and closed Friday about 11% below its 200-day line.","4 Bearish ETFs Just Right For A Wild Market With Coronavirus Volatility.

"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 17:15:22 -0400",Todd Gordon's Bearish QQQ Trade,"On CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" Todd Gordon of Ascent Wealth Partners suggested a bearish options trade in PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). He said if the current move higher in QQQ fails, it could happen between $210 to $220. If that happens, it would not be unreasonable for the stock to drop to $190. Gordon wants to make a bearish bet by buying the May $200/$190 put spread for $1.70. The trade breaks even at $198.30 or 5.32% below the closing price on Wednesday. If QQQ drops to $190 or lower at the May expiration, the trade is going to reach its maximal profit of $8.30. Even if there is just a 20% or 30% chance for this move to happen, the risk-reward is strong enough to make the trade a good proposition, said Gordon.","Todd Gordon's Bearish QQQ Trade.

He said that its behavior since January has been very poor. In March, it fell just as much as the market and it rebounded only 35%. Worth is worried about its relative performance versus PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), because it continues to stall. He sees that as a problem and he is skeptical going into the earnings. Mike Khouw has a short position in Apple. He said that it is hard for him to be optimistic about the stock. The implied volatility remains high so Khouw wants to sell the May $260 put for $5.25 and buy the July $265 put for $15. The trading structure would cost him $9.75 and he is hoping that the stock is going to stay above $260 at the May expiration and then decline below $255.25, which is around 10% below the closing price on Friday.","Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's Apple Trade.

Lately, that’s been higher, and pre-market trading pointed to more gains. Fresh catalysts are hard to find, which means we could see things drift up as reopenings seem to be going fairly well. This morning’s U.S. inflation data and testimony to Congress on COVID-19 from Dr. Anthony Fauci are the main agenda items. Consumer prices for April came in this morning at a negative 0.8%, in line with analysts’ expectations. It’s kind of like deja vu all over again, as the pace of reopenings and worries about new cases in Asia dominate the news cycle today. Kind of similar to yesterday, when stocks ended up trading both sides of the ledger before closing mixed. Reopenings seem to be going fairly well so far, but it’s obviously a small sample size. As long as that continues to be positive, it’s possible investors will continue to buy stocks. However, if cases start to increase, look for signs of people selling. Crude prices jumped 5% this morning, possibly getting some assistance from Saudi Arabia and some neighboring countries saying they’ll cut production even further. With crude now above $25 a barrel and the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rapidly moving below 30 so far this week, it looks like crude and VIX might catch each other. Who would have thought that a month ago when VIX was way above 50 and crude was heading down to ultimately below-zero on the day of the May contract closing. Monday’s flat S&P 500 (SPX) close felt kind of bittersweet. While the SPX did recover from losses at the open, the finish near 2930 came after a failure to hold session highs above 2940. The SPX continues to struggle with what might be technical resistance in the 2940–2950 region, and some analysts think a close above 2950 is needed to help squeeze some of the shorts and give the index a quick boost. It could be tough for the SPX to develop that kind of momentum if the Financial sector continues to lag and if the market can’t find fresh positive catalysts. With earnings in a lull and data not really too exciting this week, maybe stocks could find themselves in a holding pattern. That looked like the case for many sectors on Monday, with one huge exception. Couch Potatoes Ruling the Roost Stuck at home? So is the stock market, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing for investors who positioned themselves to ride this particular wave. The tide continued to roar Monday for so-called “stay at home” companies of all sorts, from cyber-security to semiconductors to gaming to big tech to data centers. This helped keep the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:QQQ) on top of the major indices as it continues to benefit from all the tech stocks that call it home. Some of the leaders Monday included Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) as the COMP rose about 0.8% for its sixth-straight positive close. AAPL is getting back near its all-time highs, and NVDA posted a new all-time high Monday. Basically, if you can use it to work or get other things done from home, it was up to start the week. What’s getting left behind again are the sectors that do better when people are out and about, like Materials, Financials, and Industrials. All those sectors fell 1% or more Monday as the market basically bifurcated. It was a bit of a conundrum seeing Financials flop Monday despite a nice rise in bond yields. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 0.7% and is now about 10 basis points above last week’s lows ahead of a large auction this week. The track of the 10-year remains a pattern to watch for potential insight into investors’ economic hopes. The yield hasn’t gone above 0.75% since April 13, so that could be a psychological resistance level. Could a push through that send a positive message through to the bank stocks? It’s anyone’s guess. Materials and Industrials haven’t gotten much of a bid recently as hopes for some sort of U.S. infrastructure passage have faded. Worries that there might not be more fiscal help from Congress could be weighing on this sector. DuPont de Nemours Inc (NYSE:DD) and Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) were among the big names not having a good Monday. In the bank sector, JP Morgan Chase Co (NYSE:JPM) continues to have trouble getting much traction above $90 a share, an area it’s been circling around for weeks. Tomorrow brings producer prices for April. The consensus is for a 0.5% decline in the headline number, according to research firm Briefing.com. However, analysts expect just a 0.2% decline in core prices, which strip out volatile energy and food. Big drops in energy prices might skew the data, though it’s worth noting that wherever deflation is coming from, it’s not a constructive thing for the economy. Not Getting a Leg Up We’re kind of in an earnings dry spell before the big retailers start reporting. Still, one company that opened the books early this week and could be thought of as a sign of the times was medical device maker Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc (NYSE:ZBH). We’ve seen a lot of headlines about how the Health Care sector has suffered from a lack of elective procedures like knee replacements as hospital resources get strapped by the pandemic, and ZBH executives offered more evidence. They talked about a deferral of procedures that they expect to continue in Q2, and have withdrawn guidance. Shares of ZBH were down Monday, but have rebounded very nicely from the March lows and are about halfway back to early 2020 highs. Though ZBH didn’t seem to please investors with its results, it and other medical device firms like Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) and Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT) could be decent barometers in coming weeks and months for a sense of whether hospitals are starting to emerge from the worst of the pandemic. Other earnings are on the calendar later this week, including Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) tomorrow afternoon and word from a couple of cruise lines on Thursday. Obviously that industry has been devastated, so hearing from executives could provide some clues about how and whether they expect any recovery. One positive is that millennials still seem interested in taking cruises once they start again, though the question is how older customers might feel. Earnings pick up next week as some of the big-box stores head to the register. That includes Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT). Also on the calendar tomorrow morning: A speech from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. That could be a chance to hear what else the Fed might have up its sleeve to help the economy recover. The title is “Current Economic Issues,” which leaves the subject matter pretty wide open, so be ready for any potential market reaction. CHART OF THE DAY: PULLING UP THE SOX: Though you could argue there’s no direct relationship between the two, the recent trend toward lower volatility (VIX—candlestick) happens to correspond with a long upswing in the semiconductors (SOX—purple line). Less volatile times do sometimes encourage investors to put their money into traditionally higher-beta stocks like the ones in SOX. Data Sources: Cboe, Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Chart Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. VIX in the Mix: During a volatile period nearly a decade ago, The Wall Street Journal ran a cute headline: “No Quick VIX For IPOs.” It was true then and true today. When VIX is historically high, few initial public offerings (IPOs) tend to happen. Why not? Partly out of general economic concerns, which tend to rise along with VIX, and also because a choppy market can make it tough to figure out how to price things. That’s a huge challenge for anyone planning an IPO, and rough for the big banks that rely partly on IPOs for their revenue. Only 35 companies went public in Q1, according to FactSet. That’s down 15% from Q1 2019 and off 35% from Q4 2019. Now comes word that online used-car seller Vroom Inc. has filed confidentially for an IPO it hopes to stage in June, MarketWatch reported. One IPO isn’t a trend, but if you start to see more of them hatch, that could be an indication of growing confidence that the most volatile times might be behind us. One positive is seeing the VIX fall well below 30 yesterday as the trend continues lower for that metric. No Guidance? Maybe No Problem: The improved spirits these last few weeks ironically correspond with an earnings season that’s seen more and more companies either pull previous guidance, decline to provide new guidance or both. You might be wondering how investors could be rewarding companies that do this, but if you think a bit deeper, it kind of makes sense. Investors seem willing to forgive some uncertainty when there’s so much up in the air surrounding the economy as a whole. On the other hand, when companies do put guidance in these confusing times, people can often get skeptical. When a company says, “We don’t know, we’re leaving it to you to try and decide,” people often tend to be a little more optimistic. When companies put hard numbers to it, you have an opportunity as an investor to say, ‘There’s no way I believe in those numbers.’ And so the takeaway some people get is that the company can’t possibly beat those, and that tends to generate less enthusiasm. End of May Could Mark an Inflection Point: A big test of the market’s optimism looms at the end of this month when a growing list of U.S. states prepare to reopen. At that point, we might find out that things can’t just return to normal the way some investors seem to expect. It goes back to the “middle seat” test we referred to a few weeks ago. When things open up, how long will it take for people to feel comfortable sitting in a middle seat on a plane, attending a festival, or going to a ballgame? It could be a long time until planes and stadiums are even close to being back where they were, even assuming virus cases start to drop. Also, if businesses open, it probably won’t be all at once. They’ll likely be having a few people at a time to start and not the full crew. A big worry for the market is that there’s an assumption things can pick up right away, but it’s going to take a while for us to get going again. That could set things up for weakness in late May or mid-June. That’s the next real test for the market. Optimism meeting reality is what’s likely going to happen there.

"Wed, 13 May 2020 08:15:07 -0400",The QQQ ETF Joins Exclusive $100B Club,"In the world of exchange traded funds, it's often said that $100 million in assets is what an issuer needs to turn a profit on a particular fund. Of course, making it to $1 billion is impressive and $10 billion is rarefied air. What Happened Speaking of exclusivity, $100 billion is truly elite company in the ETF space, but that club got a new member last week with the addition of the PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ). Bolstered by the leadership of technology and communication services equities, the Nasdaq-100 index — QQQ's underlying benchmark — recently returned to positive territory while the S&P 500 still labors in the red following the coronavirus March meltdown. Year to date, investors added $9.37 billion to QQQ — a total surpassed by just five other ETFs — vaulting the fund to nearly $104 billion in assets under management. Why It's Important The only U.S.-listed ETFs larger than QQQ are the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV), Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSE:VTI). “CFRA rates QQQ as a five-star diversified U.S. equity fund, believing it has a high probability of outperforming in the next nine months due to its low costs and high reward potential, despite slightly elevated risks,” said CFRA Research Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research Todd Rosenbluth in a Tuesday note. At $71.24 billion in assets under management, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE:AGG) is the next closest ETF to QQQ on the assets totem pole, but it could be awhile before the bond fund joins the $100 billion club. “CFRA thinks it could be three or more years before another fund joins the $100 billion club given competitive pressure and modest returns for bond funds. But actions by the Federal Reserve could boost one fund into the upper echelon,” said Rosenbluth. What's Next Past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but with the sectors QQQ is heavy performing well this year, it's hard to imagine investors won't remain fond of the fund. Plus, QQQ has history on its side when it comes to outperforming the aforementioned S&P 500 ETFs. “The Nasdaq-100 is heavily allocated towards top performing industries such as Technology, Consumer Services, and Health Care, which have helped the Nasdaq-100 outperform the S&P 500 by a wide margin between Dec. 31, 2007 and March. 31, 2020,” according to Nasdaq Global Indexes.

"Wed, 13 May 2020 12:31:02 -0400","ETF Short Sellers Are Targeting Retail, Biotech","The S&P 50o has come roaring back in the past two months, but there are still plenty of skeptics when it comes to the recent rally. There is currently $168.2 billion in aggregate domestic ETF short interest, according to S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky. Over the past month, Dusaniwsky said short sellers have been dialing back their exposure a bit as the market rallied, reducing their positions by about $18 billion. As of Tuesday, here are the six most heavily shorted domestic ETFs: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), $57.7 billion in short interest. PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), $13.8 billion in short interest. iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWM), $12.4 billion in short interest. SPDR S&P Biotech (NYSE:XBI), $6.4 billion in short interest. iShares iBoxx $ High Yid Corp Bond (NYSE:HYG), $5.9 billion in short interest. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Indx (NYSE:EEM), $3.7 billion in short interest. Short Percent Of Float By far the most heavily shorted ETF is the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 and represents a simple bet against the U.S. stock market and/or a hedge against long positions in U.S. stocks. Since mid-March, SPY short interest is up 55.1%. However, when it comes to short percent of float, the XBI Biotech ETF is has the highest of the five ETFs mentioned above at 128.1%. While it may seem alarming for more than 100% of an ETFs float to be held short, Dusaniwsky said ETF short selling is different than typical stock shorting. “SI % of Float is not as useful a metric as it is for equities because the denominator (Float) changes on a daily basis due to active ETF creations and redemptions,” he said. In fact, the XBI biotech isn’t the only ETF with a short percent of float above 100%.

The S&P 50o has come roaring back in the past two months, but there are still plenty of skeptics when it comes to the recent rally. There is currently $168.2 billion in aggregate domestic ETF short interest, according to S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky. Over the past month, Dusaniwsky said short sellers have been dialing back their exposure a bit as the market rallied, reducing their positions by about $18 billion. As of Tuesday, here are the six most heavily shorted domestic ETFs: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), $57.7 billion in short interest. PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), $13.8 billion in short interest. iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWM), $12.4 billion in short interest. SPDR S&P Biotech (NYSE:XBI), $6.4 billion in short interest. iShares iBoxx $ High Yid Corp Bond (NYSE:HYG), $5.9 billion in short interest. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Indx (NYSE:EEM), $3.7 billion in short interest. Short Percent Of Float By far the most heavily shorted ETF is the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 and represents a simple bet against the U.S. stock market and/or a hedge against long positions in U.S. stocks. Since mid-March, SPY short interest is up 55.1%. However, when it comes to short percent of float, the XBI Biotech ETF is has the highest of the five ETFs mentioned above at 128.1%. While it may seem alarming for more than 100% of an ETFs float to be held short, Dusaniwsky said ETF short selling is different than typical stock shorting. “SI % of Float is not as useful a metric as it is for equities because the denominator (Float) changes on a daily basis due to active ETF creations and redemptions,” he said. In fact, the XBI biotech isn’t the only ETF with a short percent of float above 100%. Here are the six ETFs with at least $25 million in short interest that have the highest short percent of float, according to S3: SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT), 267.6% of float. BARCLAYS IPTH SRS B S&P SHRT TRM ETN (BATS:VXX), 259.4% of float. XBI ETF, 128.1% of float. VANECK VECTORS/SEMICONDUCTOR ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), 97.7% of float.

"Tue, 09 Jun 2020 10:31:06 -0400",Cramer: NASDAQ Rebound Makes Sense As It Better Represents Economy,"All is well in the stock market universe from airline, hotel and cruise ship stocks to casino operators and everything in between. But does this rally make sense in the challenging environment? What Happened? The majority of ""recovery stocks"" are still trading at low levels and this makes it ""irresistible"" in the eyes of many investors, Jim Cramer said Monday on ""Mad Money."" But this doesn't begin to explain why the Nasdaq index is trading at historic all-time highs. It's important to understand the Nasdaq index is not composed of ""recovery stocks,"" nor does it have exposure to department stores and a ""bankrupt rental car company,"" Cramer said. Rather, the Nasdaq index is more representative of the economy and its reopening and where people are spending money. As an example, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Services revenue is seeing strong momentum, including many people starting to use Apple Pay for its ability to offer a contactless payment transaction. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is benefiting from the transition to the cloud that has become ""one of the only ways to operate,"" Cramer said. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in multiple years worth of digitization in just a few months. Why It's Important: The big tech stocks leading the Nasdaq's surge may not be up as much as ""rebound stocks,"" Cramer said, but these companies are best of the breed in their respective fields and are akin to old dogs that ""can pivot to new tricks."" See Also: Markets Soar As US Economy Ends Its Longest Expansion In History, Enters Recession What's Next?

"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 17:14:01 -0400",Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'A New Expansion',"Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: The U.S. stock market “is discounting a new expansion phase of the economy at the same time as a major recession has only just begun,” said Kevin Smith, Crescat Capital’s chief investment officer. Remember This: “The survey-type releases next week are going to be extremely important,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:AMTD). “It’s not just the headline itself, a lot of these survey types of releases have a component where they ask about future expectations. And that really to me is what’s driving optimism in the market, the expectation that things will improve in the future.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures. Technical: Mixed messages came equity indices broke the short-term, momentum-driven uptrend and corrected on June 11. Overall, the island of balance left behind, after the market sold off, is still intact and will offer resistance on upward auctions. If the market trades through that area, then sentiment has changed and the initiative activity that drove prices lower is no longer present. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Monday displayed a rejection of lower prices after overnight activity started off weak, on a gap down, but quickly corrected into the regular trading session, going higher through the $3,000 S&P 500 level. Tuesday’s trade blew through most of the resting offers overnight, into a low-volume area and on a record increase in U.S. retail sales. Later on, after a choppy open, the market established good excess on the lower extreme, and pinned near the $3,100 level. Wednesday and Thursday’s action was fairly muted as the market continued digesting the upward correction going into Friday’s simultaneous expiry of options and futures tied to index products. Despite gapping to the high end of the week-long balance overnight, Friday’s trade was volatile and lacked conviction to continue into the resting liquidity at and above the $3,135 area. Putting everything together, the picture points to the potential for a volatile week ahead. With the removal of S&P open interest, gamma — the sensitivity of options to changes in underlying price — imbalances and hedging activity could heighten volatility. If liquidation continues into the coming week and value moves lower, then the near-term bullish narrative is no longer intact. Scroll to the bottom of this story for non-profile charts.

"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 18:53:05 -0400",Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'How Long Can Tech Lead?',"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “The S&P 500 is up 1.3% month-to-date (through June 25), but has struggled to push higher as it moves towards its previous peak,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist for Ally Financial, Inc-owned (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “Looking at the breadth of the market is one way to gauge the health of the overall market. Right now, only 39% of S&P 500 stocks have closed above their 200-day moving averages, even though the S&P 500 remains above its own 200-day moving average. That has us wondering how long tech can lead the market higher on its own.” Remember This: “As good as the recent economic data has been, we want to make it clear, it could still take years for the economy to fully come back,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Think of it like building a house. You get all the big stuff done early, then some of the small things take so much longer to finish; I’m looking at you crown molding.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad market equity indices resolved a week-long balance area to the downside, albeit under weak selling. The S&P 500 index managed to one time frame lower, as evidenced by the lower highs and lows, and closed the week off below its month-to-date and week-to-date volume weighted average price benchmarks. Recapping Last Week's Action: Monday’s session closed higher without any involvement from stronger buyers. During the overnight session, before Tuesday’s regular trading, news regarding U.S. and China trade relations roiled markets. Later, statements regarding the relations were retracted, and markets retraced more than 100% of their move down. After the overnight news-driven shakeout, the market failed to find any real traction during regular trading. On Wednesday, markets liquidated on news regarding a contraction in global economic growth, later accepting prices and closing near the lows. The rotations lower were mechanical, indicative of short-term trading money. Thursday’s activity was mostly responsive, with end-of-day economic news helping fuel a spike that erased some of Wednesday’s selling. In the evening session, alongside Federal Reserve balance sheet news, markets returned to prior day value, rejecting the end-of-day spike. After the noisy overnight, markets opened Friday, liquidated and closed near the lows. Overall, despite the market losing ground, the selling was not all that intense, as evidenced by the mechanical rotations and weak migration of value. Every time the market attempted to go higher — or lower — it lacked the conviction to follow through. Though the immediate near-term trend is lower, higher prices could come just as easily on some good news. For a healthy continuation, sellers need to step up and transact in higher volumes at lower prices. You can find non-profile charts at the bottom of this story.

""A 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength. In fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past eight times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter,” LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick said in a statement. Remember This: While the risk of a national COVID-19 coronavirus resurgence remains, a more likely outcome is that localized outbreaks appear, suggested Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. Even if cases rise across the nation, most of the damage will be confined to a limited number of states, he said. As a result, without national lockdown measures, an economic recovery is likely to continue into next year, McMillan said. Pictured: profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures. Technical: Broad-market equity indices one time framed higher last week, evidenced by the higher highs and lows on the daily time frame, and closed the week off near a resistive low-volume area. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Monday, the S&P 500 established a higher low, above the year-to-date volume weighted average price, and squeezed on good delta, through resting liquidity at and above $3,020. After Tuesday’s challenge higher, the S&P retested $3,100, a high-volume area, and balanced Wednesday, building value and acceptance of $3,100 as evidenced by the responsive intraday participation. On Thursday, the U.S. economy added greater than expected payrolls, driving prices higher at the open, before establishing excess and fading to close the gap below. Overall, though extended, the market is at an important technical level. Breaking further into the prior low-volume resistance would point to a change in sentiment, quashing the initiative activity that drove prices lower in the first place. Looking beyond the broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are extended while relatively weak sectors, such as energy and financials, suggest bigger selling may be around the corner. For a continuation higher, buyers must step up on dips and increase participation in search of higher prices, helping ensure value follows closely behind.

"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 16:50:09 -0400",'Head Above Water': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: “It’s certainly been a wild ride for stocks in 2020,” noted researchers at LPL Financial. “Barely past the halfway point, the year has already brought the worst pandemic to hit the U.S. in over 100 years, an unprecedented government-induced recession as much of the country was locked down, some stomach-churning market volatility, and massive, unprecedented stimulus from policymakers totaling several trillion dollars” Remember This: “U.S. companies are about to give us a look into their worst quarter since the Great Financial Crisis,” suggested Lindsey Bell, Chief Investment Officer for Ally Financial's (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “Second-quarter earnings reports may not be pretty. But expectations for next year have stabilized. If investors stay more focused on next year’s earnings estimates than next week’s, the market will likely keep its head above water.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices balanced last week, evidenced by the responsive, tight trading range. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Monday, the S&P 500 traversed higher and left minimal excess before balancing into the close. Tuesday’s session made an attempt for Monday’s high, near $3,180, but sold off, leaving value higher and closing just below the overnight low. After a quick morning liquidation, Wednesday’s session rejected prices in the lower part of the balance area and left value overlapping, with a close at the highs. Thursday responded lower, after a quick push to the $3,170 area of resting liquidity, to and through a low volume area and the prior day’s low, before squeezing back into range. Despite the high gamma expiration suggesting many names could pin, Friday opened up around a composite high-volume area, within range, and attempted lower, before responding back through the open, and repairing earlier weak highs. Looking beyond broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are extremely extended while relatively weak sectors, such as energy and financials, have found it hard to come by support. Overall, the market is at an important level and will likely, based on its reaction to Friday’s close, experience volatility in the coming sessions.

On this day in 1998, the Nasdaq Composite Index closed above 2,000 for the first time. Where The Market Was: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day at 9,328.19 and the S&P 500 traded at 1,183.99. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 1998, France hosted and won the FIFA World Cup. The U.S. redesigned its $20 bills to make them more difficult to counterfeit. Average annual U.S. income was $38,100. Nasdaq Milestone: Almost exactly three years after closing above 1,000 for the first time on July 17, 1995, The Nasdaq Composite eclipsed the 2,000 mark for the first time on July 16, 1998. The surge in tech stocks driven by the Dot Com bubble generated major returns for Nasdaq investors in the late 1990s, and the 2,000 mark was nowhere near the peak. The Nasdaq had doubled again before the end of 1999, reaching 4,000 for the first time on December 29. Within three months, the Nasdaq reached 5,000 and hit its Dot Com bubble peak of 5,132.52 in early 2000. The party didn’t last for long, however. The bursting of the bubble sent the Nasdaq tumbling back to as low as 1,108.49 by mid-2002. Today, the Nasdaq sits around 10,500.

"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 17:32:57 -0400",Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'Cautious Attitude',"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “U.S. stocks are closing in on record highs. But behind the scenes, uneasy investors are keeping their options open,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment officer for Ally Financial Inc-owned (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “They’ve bought gold at a historical pace, boosting the metal’s price to nine-year highs. Same goes for Treasuries, which is why yields are at all-time lows. Lately, we’ve seen that cautious attitude spread to the U.S. options market. A gauge of market worry (the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX) is stuck at higher-than-average levels, even though stocks are hovering just below their own highs.” Remember This: ""You have monetary and fiscal policy pushing the economy out of a problem and that is very, very bullish,"" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Investment Management. ""When you have these extreme accommodative policies it is because there is a problem in the economy. Investors historically focus on the problem and are cautious, yet that’s when you want to get most optimistic."" Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices balanced higher last week, as seen in the responsive, tight trading range. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Monday, the S&P 500 gapped higher, outside of a prior balance area, but failed to continue, rotating back into the prior week’s range. Tuesday’s session continued Monday’s selling activity, but reversed just short of the prior balance area low. After news that Moderna Inc’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine produced antibodies, Wednesday’s session saw prices pushing higher, gapping beyond Tuesday’s range. Buyers attempted to burst through the resting liquidity at $3,230, but failed with prices later following the Nasdaq’s relative weakness lower to close the overnight gap. After some mixed economic data, Thursday's session was dominated by responsive activity, balancing out near Wednesday’s V-bottom low, with sellers lacking conviction the most via the minimal excess low. Alongside monthly options expiry, Friday’s session continued Thursday’s tone, with the intraday trading range remaining tight and responsive. Looking beyond broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are showing signs of relative weakness, while other sectors, such as industrials, energy and financials are rotating higher off recent support. Overall, the market is in a three-day balance that it’s likely to break come next week. Positive news regarding a vaccine, earnings and stimulus may help further squeeze shorts as we look to fill the gap above, left from late February.

"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 13:05:17 -0400",Option Signal Alerts To Grow Your Trading Account,"Options have gained tremendous popularity because traders can risk less and make more. The problem with purchasing options: one must be correct in their assumption on direction, time and volatility. Thus, since options are depreciating assets with fixed maturities, one of the best ways to make consistent returns from purchasing options is to have access to timely insights, like unusual option signals or an options scanner. Trading On The News When it comes to the market, time is the regulator of opportunity. However, without access to the same insights institutional investors have, how does one quickly act on emerging market opportunities? Well, look no further: Benzinga Pro is the one-stop-shop for investing based on financials, news, charting and order flow. One of Pro’s most sought after tools in the Options Signals Scanner feature, which alerts traders to price or volume related events in real-time, such as price spikes, unusual options activity, block trades, halts, opening gaps and more. Image of the Benzinga Pro Unusual Activity Monitor. The Options Signals data can be filtered by asset class, sector, security, types of trades, quantity, market cap, float, financial ratios and more. In addition, traders can quickly derive option order flow context and conviction via Benzinga’s one-sentence Why Is It Moving (WIIM) insights. Examples Of Options Signals Scanner Data In Action In the image above, one trader made a bearish bet on Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD). The order was filled as a Sweep, meaning it was executed across multiple exchanges, typically a high-conviction bet. In another trade, an investor bought PowerShares QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) call options above the asking price. Option order flow is a sentiment analysis indicator that helps gauge directional bets. Typically, activity at a certain strike near the bid points to selling, while activity near the ask points to buying. Orders above the ask are considered to be high-conviction trades, too, since they are executed at a price that exceeds the current market mid-price. In the QQQ example, despite market uncertainty, one large investor was willing to overpay for upside exposure in the Nasdaq. So, if a Benzinga Pro user is alerted to very active call buying through the options signal scanner, they can quickly follow along with the unusual activity, using options to risk less and make more.

"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 15:47:02 -0400",How Market Fragmentation Hurts The Retail Trader,"Stock market fragmentation is a hot topic of debate on Wall Street, but Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep co-host Dennis Dick said Friday that he’s getting increasingly frustrated with trading in such a fragmented market. Fragmentation refers to the fact that there are 13 exchanges and more than 30 active alternative trading systems out there today. While those in favor of fragmentation see it as boosting market liquidity, others say it creates opportunity for pricing shenanigans. Fragmentation Fallout: In Friday morning’s pre-market session, Dick was frustrated because he was seeing trades in a particular stock executed on another exchange when he had a limit sell order set at a much lower price. “They say fragmentation is good for the investor, and they don’t realize I’m selling the stock at $108.80 and it’s printing $109.70 [on NSDQ],” Dick said. “I don’t know who controls the routing or if they’re intentionally routing around my order and this is an entire market structure issue. But believe me, this happens because you don’t have any book protection in the premarket at all.” Dick said traders can set a limit price for an order, and that stock can trade through that price on a different exchange in the pre-market session without the trader’s limit order ever getting filled. Fragmentation muddies the waters and likely allows brokers to route around retail orders and fill their own orders first. “Regulators, if you’re listening, fragmentation sucks...I’m out there offering a stock at $108 and it’s printing $110!” Dick said. “I’m on NSDQ, and it prints on Arca. Then I move to Arca and it moves to NSDQ. And obviously a lot of retail traders that don’t control routing may not notice this type of stuff, but you see it happen where they’re trading through your price and you don’t get filled.” Too Many Exchanges: Dick said the CME and the futures market are so efficient because all the trades happen on one exchange. “You have every stock trading on 13 bloody exchanges, you’ve got all these other stocks trading on dark pools--you’ve got 50 different dark pools. You’ve got off-exchange market makers that are trading and controlling all the retail flow, capturing all that, doing 25% or 30%, taking it away from the public markets where they’re just printing and matching the best price,” Dick said. Not only was he unable to get his price on the shares he was trying to sell, but the buyer who bought at the higher price was a victim as well. Dick has previously met with regulators to discuss this type of fallout from market fragmentation, but he said nothing has changed from a regulatory perspective while the fragmentation gets worse. “Why do you think you get free trades on all these platforms? So they can control your routing, route your orders around and screw the limit orders that are out there.” Watch Dennis' full rant in the clip below, or listen to the podcast here PreMarket Prep is a daily trading show hosted by prop trader Dennis Dick and former floor trader Joel Elconin.

(NASDAQ:FB), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). To set up the hedge, Khouw wants to use PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). To figure out how many put options he needs to buy, he needs to divide $100,000 with the price of QQQ, which is at $255.56. The result is the number of shares you need to sell and in this case, it's around 400 shares. Since Khouw wants to use options, he needs to buy four puts. Specifically, he would buy four contracts of the September $240 puts for $6.50 each. The total cost for the hedge would be $2,600 or 2.6% of his portfolio.

"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 11:12:13 -0400",How to Score Quick Profits Out of This NASDAQ Rally,"The NASDAQ has been out of control lately but in a good way. If you’re like me and you didn’t get your Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) from the Small Business Association (SBA), you could have still pulled a bit of the Fed’s stimulus money out of the stock market. You see, everybody else’s EIDL has been pumping up the price of NASDAQ stocks for a few weeks now. Go Fed. Source: Business Insider — President Donald Trump side-eyeing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell The problem is that no one knows when this insane rally will end. No one wants to be the one left buying at the top and holding the bag. At the same time, no risk, no reward. Scared money doesn’t make money. Put up or shut up. Nothing is for sure in the stock market, especially in the modern market of flash crashes. (Here’s a market lingo joke I just thought of. The stock market has so many bubbles, it’s no wonder so many traders are taking a bath.) Jokes aside, you should rely on your broker to provide you with tools to monitor market activity. If you have good tools, you can analyze and play off of a market hypothesis. You don't have to be perfect. All you have to be is smarter than the biggest dummy. Take a look at a couple of fairly conservative strategies you can implement in today’s market without frying your nervous system. Selling Out of the Money Calls When a market is moving directionally, selling out of the money (OTM) options is a great way to cash in and leave yourself a cushion to be wrong. For instance: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been on rocket boosters and is now trading at $440. You are ok owning it at $400, but you don’t want to buy any more at $440. If you sell puts with a strike price of $400, you profit if AAPL continues to rise. But here’s the cool part — if you’re wrong about the direction and AAPL falls to $430 at the option expiration date, you STILL profit. The problem with OTM calls is that they can be expensive. Any profit you make on that AAPL trade could be eaten up by the broker commission fees — unless you are trading on Webull. Webull offers $0 options contracts and commissions, leaving you with plenty of room to rake in your winnings without paying the middleman. (If you need help on the terms I used in this example, be sure to check out Benzinga’s options trading course.) Investing in an Index Sophisticated traders will never answer the newbie question, “Got any good stocks?” Profitable traders know the way to success is to play with ranges and probabilities. Betting on the up or down movement of an individual stock at any given time is just gambling. Don’t ever let past performance fool you into thinking the future will go the same way. The market is set up to make as many people wrong as possible. If you are a beginner, the way to avoid the volatile swings of individual stocks is to instantly diversify through index holdings. If you want to bet on the NASDAQ, you can bet on the entire thing through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). You gain instant exposure to the entire index, which moves a bit more smoothly than any 1 stock within it. This is also an easy trade with Webull. ETFs trade like stocks even though they represent a basket of stocks. All you do is pull up the QQQ ticker symbol in your Webull interface, set your amount, and you have instant diversification. Scalping Scalping a trade involves taking just a little bit of profit off of the top. You buy naked calls if you think the stock will rise or naked puts if you think the stock will fall. Whether the market moves with your trade or against you, you are out of the trade in seconds on its next move. Some traders may tell you that scalping is dangerous, but only under certain conditions. Here are the rules for beginner scalpers: Do not use margin. Use only 1% of your trading account per trade. Do not get greedy and stay in a trade beyond the first move. Cut losses immediately. Set the amount you are willing to lose daily and stop trading if you lose that amount. With 0% commissions on options, Webull makes scalping a viable option even for those with small accounts. If you think that I’m biased towards Webull in certain trading situations, it’s true. Your broker should match your trading personality. If you’re a new trader with an interest in options, Webull is a great platform to get started on. It certainly helps that you don’t have to pay your broker to learn the tool - 0% options is not an automatic feature for many top brokers!","How to Score Quick Profits Out of This NASDAQ Rally.

"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 17:39:33 -0400",'A Long Way To Go': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Stocks closed the week higher after investors regained optimism regarding a sustained recovery. Remember This: “Earnings season has been very impressive so far, now you can couple that with the employment backdrop quickly improving as well. Not a bad combo for investors,” said Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist at the LPL Financial. “Still, let's be realistic, 10% unemployment isn't anything to get overly excited about and we still have a long way to go to get back to February levels of output.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices resolved a prior balance area to the upside, evidenced by a successful breakout and migration of value. Recapping last week’s action: On Monday, as M&A activity lifted sentiment and efforts to hammer out a coronavirus relief bill resumed, the S&P 500 moved out of a multi-week balance area, finishing further into the low-volume area left from the late February sell-off. Overnight, prices caught up to Monday’s divergent delta after disappointing earnings reports from Europe and a sharp rebuke from China. Tuesday’s U.S. session managed to get past the uninspiring news, closing higher and validating the breakout from balance. Indices continued their trek higher Wednesday, closing and establishing value above prior balance on upbeat economic data and positive earnings. Pre-U.S. open, on Thursday, the S&P filled a prior gap, finding liquidity at the $3,300 strike before climbing higher, on poor structure and ahead of value, as investors reacted to upbeat jobless claims data. Friday’s U.S. session further digested data on jobs, spending most of the cash session accepting value in the higher end of Thursday’s trading range, before squeezing into the close. In light of mostly unchanged fundamental conditions, equity indices are positioned for further upside. Overall, the market appears to be migrating value higher, confirming the bullish trend. News regarding improving fundamentals and stimulus is likely to buoy the S&P in subsequent sessions.

"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 18:34:07 -0400",'A Subdued Market': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “This is a subdued market. We have recovered from the shock, but there have been a lot of sectors not really participating that much on the upside,” said ARK Invest CEO and CIO Catherine Wood. Remember This: “2020 is a year that is setting many records, some good and some bad, and now we have the best 100-day rally ever,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The real catch to this though is that previous big rallies usually saw continued strength, so don’t bet against this bull market just yet.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices digested prior advances, evidenced by the non-separation of value. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Monday's higher open on pandemic relief efforts coming from the White House was erased on a liquidation to Friday’s range. Buyers later responded, establishing a V-bottom before resolving the contract-adjusted all-time-high overnight. After investors shrugged off news of simmering geopolitical tensions, Tuesday’s U.S. session gave back all advances, liquidating enough to repair the poor structure below $3,330. Alongside news of resilient fuel demand, relative strength shifted to the Nasdaq Wednesday, with equity indices squeezing shorts and erasing the low-volume area left behind Tuesday’s liquidation. Thursday’s overnight activity caught up to Wednesday’s divergent delta, drifting lower alongside uninspiring political news. During the U.S. session, the S&P managed to pop higher, to and through the resting liquidity at the $3,375 area, before testing lower and closing in-range, neutral. The session’s narrative carried forward with Friday ending the week in-balance and range. In light of dull participation, the risks of a pullback have increased. Buyers lack the conviction to follow-through and sellers are beginning to step up on the liquidations that get rid of those weak buyers. The Russell 2000 closed the week off lower after coming to the $1,600 supply area. The Nasdaq, despite regaining relative strength, failed to make a new high, balancing out into the week's end. To see a positive change in tone, there needs to be separation of value beyond the all-time-high.

"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 14:56:29 -0400",'Psychological Milestone': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “The market has taken us on a roller coaster ride that no one would have believed — from the depths of March 2020, when we dropped to a level last seen in 2016 (e.g., $2,237.40 on the S&P 500) to a 51% rally back to reclaim an all-time high,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. Remember This: “We’ve officially entered a new bull market,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Financial Inc (NYSE:ALLY)-owned Ally Invest. “For some, it’s a major psychological milestone. Things still feel far from normal, but the market has successfully summited a mountain of worry. And when a new high follows a major decline, momentum tends to be on the market’s side. Since 1950, the S&P usually hits multiple record highs in the month after reaching its post bear-market peak.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week mixed, with the S&P 500 recovering its all-time high on relative strength from the technology sector. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Monday’s higher open on earnings and stimulus talks was followed by a balanced, low-volume session which migrated value to the top of prior balance. The market caught up to Monday’s delta, edging higher overnight on better-than-expected retail earnings, before liquidating, making a V-shape recovery and resolving some resting liquidity at and above the $3,390 area. On Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve signaled signs of a difficult recovery, the market left value behind on a spike and repaired some weak structure in the $3,350 region. Responsive buyers quashed Wednesday’s weak-handed initiative activity, driving prices higher into Friday’s monthly options expiration, albeit with minimal participation from the broader market. Overall, the week ended in balance again. In light of dull participation and poor structure on both sides of the market, attention has to be shifted to other stimuli, such as the cessation of a trend in heavily weighted index constituents and decreased dealer hedging flows. If momentum was to grow faint, there’s the potential for a fast-moving correction of the poor structure created by anxiety-driven participants. Still, the path of least resistance is up.

The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “The market has taken us on a roller coaster ride that no one would have believed — from the depths of March 2020, when we dropped to a level last seen in 2016 (e.g., $2,237.40 on the S&P 500) to a 51% rally back to reclaim an all-time high,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. Remember This: “We’ve officially entered a new bull market,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Financial Inc (NYSE:ALLY)-owned Ally Invest. “For some, it’s a major psychological milestone. Things still feel far from normal, but the market has successfully summited a mountain of worry. And when a new high follows a major decline, momentum tends to be on the market’s side. Since 1950, the S&P usually hits multiple record highs in the month after reaching its post bear-market peak.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week mixed, with the S&P 500 recovering its all-time high on relative strength from the technology sector. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Monday’s higher open on earnings and stimulus talks was followed by a balanced, low-volume session which migrated value to the top of prior balance. The market caught up to Monday’s delta, edging higher overnight on better-than-expected retail earnings, before liquidating, making a V-shape recovery and resolving some resting liquidity at and above the $3,390 area. On Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve signaled signs of a difficult recovery, the market left value behind on a spike and repaired some weak structure in the $3,350 region. Responsive buyers quashed Wednesday’s weak-handed initiative activity, driving prices higher into Friday’s monthly options expiration, albeit with minimal participation from the broader market. Overall, the week ended in balance again. In light of dull participation and poor structure on both sides of the market, attention has to be shifted to other stimuli, such as the cessation of a trend in heavily weighted index constituents and decreased dealer hedging flows. If momentum was to grow faint, there’s the potential for a fast-moving correction of the poor structure created by anxiety-driven participants. Still, the path of least resistance is up.

"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 14:32:16 -0400",'A Clear Break With Prevailing Policy': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended positive, with broad gains in all S&P 500 sectors. Remember This: “Some data suggests consumer health has started to improve,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Financial Inc (NYSE:ALLY)-owned Ally Invest. “A consumer who’s still willing to spend on certain discretionary items has emerged. And a company that offers that consumer what they want, where they want (and feel safe), may be seeing its stock price benefit.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 Micro E-mini Futures. Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week higher, with the S&P 500 establishing a new all-time high on broad gains from all sectors. Recapping Last Week's Action: Monday’s higher open on the FDA’s approval for emergency use of antibody-rich plasma on COVID-19 patients was followed by a balanced, low-volume session that migrated value higher. On Tuesday, the market continued squeezing overnight on positive trade news and supportive delta before correcting inventory down to a prior session low-volume area and making a failed attempt at the overnight high. Wednesday’s U.S. session resolved Tuesday’s overnight weak high as investors flocked to momentum. The tone continued through Friday as the Federal Reserve’s policy shift on inflation bolstered gains in all 11 of the S&P 500 sectors. Overall, in light of the short-term, momentum-driven activity and poor structure on both sides of the market, the risks for a near-term correction have increased. That said, heavily-weighted index constituents are still in an uptrend and all sectors saw gains. As of now, the path of least resistance is still up. If the momentum were to fade, there’s the potential for a fast-moving correction of the poor structure left behind by the recent anxiety-driven activity. Scroll to the bottom of this story to view non-profile charts. Fundamental: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell unveiled a strategy that targets an average rate of inflation of 2%. “Whereas previously, the Fed would be willing to hike interest rates as the labour market approached estimates of maximum employment, Powell has made it clear that uncertainty around these estimates mean that they will not be relied upon as much in the future,"" Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said in a statement on the development. ""Instead, Powell stated ‘employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation.’ This is a clear break with prevailing policy wisdom going back as far as the 1980s — its significance is difficult to overstate.” The development comes after the Fed’s monetary policy, after the last financial crisis, failed to stimulate economic activity sufficiently to lift inflation over 2%. As a result, this new shift means the Federal Reserve will tolerate hot inflation and allow employment to drop below inflationary levels.

The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended positive, with broad gains in all S&P 500 sectors. Remember This: “Some data suggests consumer health has started to improve,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Financial Inc (NYSE:ALLY)-owned Ally Invest. “A consumer who’s still willing to spend on certain discretionary items has emerged. And a company that offers that consumer what they want, where they want (and feel safe), may be seeing its stock price benefit.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 Micro E-mini Futures. Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week higher, with the S&P 500 establishing a new all-time high on broad gains from all sectors. Recapping Last Week's Action: Monday’s higher open on the FDA’s approval for emergency use of antibody-rich plasma on COVID-19 patients was followed by a balanced, low-volume session that migrated value higher. On Tuesday, the market continued squeezing overnight on positive trade news and supportive delta before correcting inventory down to a prior session low-volume area and making a failed attempt at the overnight high. Wednesday’s U.S. session resolved Tuesday’s overnight weak high as investors flocked to momentum. The tone continued through Friday as the Federal Reserve’s policy shift on inflation bolstered gains in all 11 of the S&P 500 sectors. Overall, in light of the short-term, momentum-driven activity and poor structure on both sides of the market, the risks for a near-term correction have increased. That said, heavily-weighted index constituents are still in an uptrend and all sectors saw gains. As of now, the path of least resistance is still up. If the momentum were to fade, there’s the potential for a fast-moving correction of the poor structure left behind by the recent anxiety-driven activity. Scroll to the bottom of this story to view non-profile charts. Fundamental: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell unveiled a strategy that targets an average rate of inflation of 2%. “Whereas previously, the Fed would be willing to hike interest rates as the labour market approached estimates of maximum employment, Powell has made it clear that uncertainty around these estimates mean that they will not be relied upon as much in the future,"" Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said in a statement on the development. ""Instead, Powell stated ‘employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation.’ This is a clear break with prevailing policy wisdom going back as far as the 1980s — its significance is difficult to overstate.” The development comes after the Fed’s monetary policy, after the last financial crisis, failed to stimulate economic activity sufficiently to lift inflation over 2%. As a result, this new shift means the Federal Reserve will tolerate hot inflation and allow employment to drop below inflationary levels.

The prior U.S. record was Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which lost $120 billion in one day back in July 2018 due to weak earnings and the Cambridge Analytica data-mining scandal. The global record was set by Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), which lost $143 billion back in October 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.79% to 28,289.63. The S&P 500 closed down 3.46% to $3,456.79. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 4.96% to $11,458.10. Why It Matters: The Nasdaq index has only lost 2.5% or more the day after hitting a record high, as it did in Wednesday’s trading session, nine times. The “Fab 5” mega-cap stocks, which include Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), lost over $500 billion in combined market cap Thursday. This was the biggest percentage drop for Apple shares since their 12.9% loss back on March 16. “The stock market has run a long way in a short amount of time, particularly in the technology sector. This market has been due for a pullback. Actually, overdue,” Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said in an email.

"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 12:15:18 -0400",'Caution But Not Bearishness': Analysts Respond To Tech Stock Plunge,"Large-cap tech stocks were hammered on Thursday, with the S&P 500 dropping 3.5% and the Nasdaq trading lower by 5%. While tech investors took a big hit on the day, the sell-off came with both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq trading at all-time highs. The sell-off was led by Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), both of which split their stock on Monday. Following Thursday’s session, Apple is down more than 10% from recent highs, while Tesla declined 18% in just three days. Several analysts and experts have weighed in on Thursday’s sell-off and how investors should approach the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the POWERSHARES QQQ/UT SER 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) in the wake of the drop. Caution Warranted: DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas said the market continues to trade similarly to the way it did in 2009 during the early stages of its recovery from the financial crisis. “To the letter of the Playbook, we may need to see another 5% decline but given 2020’s general outperformance that may not come to pass,” Colas said Thursday. “Today was a bad day, and our price-leads-fundamentals mantra says caution – but not bearishness – is in order.” Nigel Green, founder of deVere Group, said savvy, long-term investors will likely see an opportunity in high-growth tech names now that Thursday’s drop removed some of the froth from the market. “With some talk of markets being on the brink of correction territory, profit-taking, mispricing of high-quality equities, and lower entry points, this will be seen by many as a major buying opportunity – especially after global equity markets recently hit new highs,” Green said. Stay The Course: Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, is encouraging his clients to stay the course with their long-term investing plans. “We don’t believe the bull market is going to end any time soon, but a healthy pullback or even a correction is part of all bull markets and it’s easy to point to the November election, news that China is pursuing their own home-grown chip-making industry, or the upcoming flu season as a reasons to get bearish,” Zaccarelli said. Peter Essele, Head of Portfolio Management for Commonwealth Financial Network, said the sell-off seemed to be concentrated mostly in red-hot tech stocks, suggesting momentum traders may be rushing for the exits. “It’s possible that today’s market is an indication of things to come, where fundamentals play a larger part in valuations, as opposed to the irrational exuberance that has persisted in recent months within tech,” Essele said. Benzinga’s Take: Whether or not Thursday’s sell-off is a big deal simply depends on your investment time horizon. Short-term and medium-term traders are rightly concerned that the record rally since late March has finally run out of steam ahead of a potentially chaotic U.S. election in November, while long-term investors can simply sit back and ignore the day-to-day and week-to-week fluctuations in the market.

"Mon, 07 Sep 2020 09:40:22 -0400",'Deflationary Undercurrent': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended negative on relative weakness from the technology sector. Remember This: “August benefited from multiple tailwinds, resulting in one of the best Augusts on record. Those tailwinds look stretched and at risk, however,” said Brad McMillan, CIO for Commonwealth Financial Network. “September is also historically one of the weakest months for the market, raising risks on a calendar basis, even before we consider the real possibility that the medical, economic, and market risks will reassert themselves.” Pictured: Profile chart of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week lower with the S&P 500 correcting nearly 7%. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Alongside bets of an economic revival backed by prolonged central bank support, the S&P 500 established an overnight all-time high, prior to correcting lower, below value, and trading responsively into the close. On upbeat manufacturing data, Tuesday’s trade built on the prior day’s positive delta, finishing higher on a late spike. Fueled by momentum in tech, Wednesday’s session opened on a gap, accepted the prior day’s spike, and placed initiative buyers firmly in control. After a brief test lower, regular trading discovered prices higher, leaving value and delta behind. At one point sellers finally entered and established excess on a spike high, suggesting the area could be resistive on subsequent tests. Indices dropped overnight, Thursday, ahead of economic releases, catching up to the prior day’s divergent delta. After an open below the prior day’s excess, participants rejected higher prices and fueled an emotional liquidation that repaired numerous sessions worth of poor structure. In Friday’s auction, participants continued the push lower before rejecting the low-volume area at $3,400 on a virgin test, and rotating back to test the supply area near $3,460. Overall, despite the speculative call-side activity in large technology names that forced dealers to hedge in the direction of the trend, prices did manage to auction high enough to attract stronger selling. Given the immense amount of poor structure created by the short-term, momentum-driven participation, it’s no wonder why the corrective action was so fierce. Whether this sell-off is nothing more than a short-term inventory correction, the presence of additional poor structure below us, coupled with a mixed fundamental picture, suggests there may be more downside in play. That said, heavily-weighted index constituents are in an uptrend, while major market indices are in a short gamma, high-volatility environment. Regardless of trend or volatility, it’s time to closely assess how far indices have come and the potential for further upside. Scroll to the bottom of this page for non-profile charts. Fundamental: Given the market’s strength going into the U.S. presidential election, ARK Invest CEO and CIO Catherine Wood suggested the multiple structure of the market will continue rising, given the deflationary nature of innovation. “The P/E ratio of the S&P 500, right now, is at about 26 times on this year’s earnings and about 20 to 21 on next year’s earnings,"" said Wood. ""Now, we should be looking into next year -- the market is a discounting mechanism. But, to the extent a correction makes people a little more focused on the short term, they’re looking at 26 times this year, and that typically has been the top of the market.” “We’re in a deflationary world, thanks to the innovations that are sweeping through the world that are all deflationary in nature. You know the ones we talk about -- our five platforms -- DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology. As they sweep through the world, there’s going to be a deflationary undercurrent, even as unit growth is very rapid. That is highly positive for P/E ratios.” Wood finished noting that investors may see multiples as high as 33 to 50 and near term corrections are a test of growth’s resilience in the new age of digital disruption and accelerated innovation.

Recapping Last Week’s Action: Alongside bets of an economic revival backed by prolonged central bank support, the S&P 500 established an overnight all-time high, prior to correcting lower, below value, and trading responsively into the close. On upbeat manufacturing data, Tuesday’s trade built on the prior day’s positive delta, finishing higher on a late spike. Fueled by momentum in tech, Wednesday’s session opened on a gap, accepted the prior day’s spike, and placed initiative buyers firmly in control. After a brief test lower, regular trading discovered prices higher, leaving value and delta behind. At one point sellers finally entered and established excess on a spike high, suggesting the area could be resistive on subsequent tests. Indices dropped overnight, Thursday, ahead of economic releases, catching up to the prior day’s divergent delta. After an open below the prior day’s excess, participants rejected higher prices and fueled an emotional liquidation that repaired numerous sessions worth of poor structure. In Friday’s auction, participants continued the push lower before rejecting the low-volume area at $3,400 on a virgin test, and rotating back to test the supply area near $3,460. Overall, despite the speculative call-side activity in large technology names that forced dealers to hedge in the direction of the trend, prices did manage to auction high enough to attract stronger selling. Given the immense amount of poor structure created by the short-term, momentum-driven participation, it’s no wonder why the corrective action was so fierce. Whether this sell-off is nothing more than a short-term inventory correction, the presence of additional poor structure below us, coupled with a mixed fundamental picture, suggests there may be more downside in play. That said, heavily-weighted index constituents are in an uptrend, while major market indices are in a short gamma, high-volatility environment. Regardless of trend or volatility, it’s time to closely assess how far indices have come and the potential for further upside. Scroll to the bottom of this page for non-profile charts. Fundamental: Given the market’s strength going into the U.S. presidential election, ARK Invest CEO and CIO Catherine Wood suggested the multiple structure of the market will continue rising, given the deflationary nature of innovation. “The P/E ratio of the S&P 500, right now, is at about 26 times on this year’s earnings and about 20 to 21 on next year’s earnings,"" said Wood. ""Now, we should be looking into next year -- the market is a discounting mechanism. But, to the extent a correction makes people a little more focused on the short term, they’re looking at 26 times this year, and that typically has been the top of the market.” “We’re in a deflationary world, thanks to the innovations that are sweeping through the world that are all deflationary in nature. You know the ones we talk about -- our five platforms -- DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology. As they sweep through the world, there’s going to be a deflationary undercurrent, even as unit growth is very rapid. That is highly positive for P/E ratios.” Wood finished noting that investors may see multiples as high as 33 to 50 and near term corrections are a test of growth’s resilience in the new age of digital disruption and accelerated innovation.

What Happened: For those wondering from where many Nasdaq-100 members hail, the answer is easy: the Nasdaq Q-50 Index (NXTQ), a benchmark that is something of a “junior varsity” for aspiring NDX members. With Thursday's debut of the VictoryShares Nasdaq Next 50 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQN), the Q-50 Index finally has an ETF linked to it. “Finally” because the NDX proving ground is nearly 13 years old. “The Index is comprised of 50 securities ranked by market capitalization and reflects companies across major industry groups including computer hardware and software, telecommunications, retail/wholesale trade, and biotechnology. It does not contain securities of financial companies including banking and investment companies, as these are ineligible for NASDAQ-100 Index inclusion,” according to Nasdaq Global Indexes. Why It's Important: Reminding investors that past performance doesn't guarantee future results is particularly relevant with QQQN, but it's worth noting some previous Nasdaq Q-50 members went on to become story stocks, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and, this year, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). Top holdings in the new QQQN included Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL), Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) and Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM). The NASDAQ Q-50 Index is currently home to 48 securities, not 50. “The Nasdaq Q-50 Index has been live and proven for more than 10 years. Its methodology aligns with the innovation and growth focus behind the time-tested Nasdaq-100 Index, but with an emphasis on forward-thinking companies on the vanguard of market leadership and technological advancement,” according to Victory Capital. What's Next: Given the market capitalization range of many of QQQN's smaller to medium-sized components, the new ETF can be an alternative to traditional mid-cap strategies. Since its inception, the Q-50 Index nearly doubled the performance of the Russell Midcap Index. Like the Nasdaq-100, QQQN and the Q-50 Index are heavy on technology stocks. That sector accounts for 45.73% of the new ETF's weight with health care and industrial names combining for almost 32%. QQQN charges 0.18% percent per year, or $18 on a $10,000 investment, making it slightly less expensive than the comparable Nasdaq-100 tracking ETF.

Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Tuesday, alongside Brexit news, on a second attempt, the S&P 500 broke through the 3,400 low-volume area, suggesting directional conviction changed.

Selling intensified as the market ate into prior low-volume, before closing off on a weak low, in-line with the prior day's cash-session low. After tech shares led an overnight rally up to some low-volume areas from the prior day's session, machine-like selling appeared and pushed the market through the weak low’s, before buyer's regained strength to finish Friday off in-range. Overall, the recent mechanical activity to and from key technical levels denotes the non-presence of larger other time frame (OTF) participants and conviction. Heavily weighted index constituents are breaking trend while the broad market’s failure to extend much lower into the poor structure below it, coupled with reduced volatility pressures, suggests immediate downside may be limited. As a result, it’s time to temper expectations and look to reposition in line with emerging macro-economic and geopolitical themes. Scroll to the bottom for non-profile charts. Fundamental: ARK Invest analyst Sam Korus suggested that the risks to auto loans, the securities supporting them, and underlying collateral may threaten the entire auto ecosystem. “The percent of auto loans delinquent by 90 days or more has been rising for almost four years and is approaching levels last seen during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, as shown below. During the GFC, most consumers and businesses prioritized the servicing of auto loans over their mortgages because, in the absence of ride-hailing, they relied on vehicles to keep their jobs and businesses going. Now working from home, they seem to be prioritizing mortgages and home equity (HE) loans over auto and credit card debt.” Korus also noted delinquencies may double while the underlying collateral will likely see a depression in residual value due to the mobility revolution. As a result, consumers, lenders, dealerships, and auto manufacturers may suffer financial damage as secular risks rebound in the tail-end of the COVID-19 recovery.

Overall, the recent mechanical activity to and from key technical levels denotes the non-presence of larger other time frame (OTF) participants and conviction. Heavily weighted index constituents are breaking trend while the broad market’s failure to extend much lower into the poor structure below it, coupled with reduced volatility pressures, suggests immediate downside may be limited. As a result, it’s time to temper expectations and look to reposition in line with emerging macro-economic and geopolitical themes. Scroll to the bottom for non-profile charts. Fundamental: ARK Invest analyst Sam Korus suggested that the risks to auto loans, the securities supporting them, and underlying collateral may threaten the entire auto ecosystem. “The percent of auto loans delinquent by 90 days or more has been rising for almost four years and is approaching levels last seen during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, as shown below. During the GFC, most consumers and businesses prioritized the servicing of auto loans over their mortgages because, in the absence of ride-hailing, they relied on vehicles to keep their jobs and businesses going. Now working from home, they seem to be prioritizing mortgages and home equity (HE) loans over auto and credit card debt.” Korus also noted delinquencies may double while the underlying collateral will likely see a depression in residual value due to the mobility revolution. As a result, consumers, lenders, dealerships, and auto manufacturers may suffer financial damage as secular risks rebound in the tail-end of the COVID-19 recovery.

What Are ETFs? ETF stands for exchange-traded funds. An ETF is an investment fund that trades on a stock exchange along with stocks for individual companies. ETFs track an index like the S&P 500, track a sector, represent a commodity (like gold, oil or wheat) or sample a basket of stocks or bonds that meet a given criteria. Exchange-traded funds are popular with investors given they can help mitigate risk in your portfolio. For example: QQQ is an ETF that represents 100 of the largest companies by market capitalization on the NASDAQ. This week we posed the following question related to five popular exchange-traded funds: Over the next five years, which ETF will have the largest percentage gain? SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NASDAQ:XLF) iShares Silver Trust (NASDAQ:SLV) MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NASDAQ:EEM) Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) Which ETF Will Grow the Most? Out of the five ETFs we surveyed investors on, 36.9% of traders and investors agreed that the QQQ ETF will experience the largest percentage growth over the next five years. Not far behind: 30% of respondents told us SPY, the first ETF listed in the U.S. and the largest ETF fund in the world by market capitalization, would be the strongest performing ETF by 2025. Less popular with investors were the EEM and SLV ETFs, accumulating 14.6% and 12.3% of support. Respondents to our weekly study were the least keen on the XLF, an ETF fund known for its large bank concentration. Only 6.2% said XLF would be the largest gaining ETF by 2025.

What Happened: Last month, Wilson had called the peak in S&P 500 after the massive rally, which led to a lopsided market. ""We expect a growth scare to be followed by a rate scare over the next weeks/months that could finally give us the first tradable correction in the major U.S. equity indexes. It could begin imminently,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Nasdaq 100 is down 13% from its Sept. 2 high, falling below its 50-day average and underperforming the S&P 500 for the first time in a year. The historic rally has led to a positive sentiment bubble in the last few months led by tech, and the selloff hasn't cleared the bubble yet. Nasdaq 100 is at the risk of falling to its 200-day average level of 9,258, implying a 12% drop from current levels, according to Wilson. ""This is what happens when stocks get so extended - corrections can be much bigger when remaining in an uptrend,"" wrote Wilson. Why It's Important: The biggest tech ETF, PowerShares QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), lost money at the fastest rate in two decades on Friday, and large speculators boosted the net bearish positions in Nasdaq futures to a 12-year high, according to Bloomberg. Hedge funds have stayed decidedly long tech and growth stocks due to the outsized returns of internet and software companies, but this also highlights the danger — should the sentiment start to sour, Wilson said. As many funds are letting the money ride, it may be fuel for the ""correction to go a little further than most are expecting,"" he wrote.","Tech Selloff Is Far From Over, Warns Morgan Stanley.

There is currently $185 billion in aggregate ETF short interest in the U.S. market, up from just $154 billion in March, according to S3 Partners. S3 analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said Tuesday that ETF short interest has increased by $1.1 billion in the past week alone. Most Shorted ETFs: By far the most heavily shorted ETF is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). The SPY ETF tracks the S&P 500 and represents a simple bet against the U.S. stock market and/or a hedge against long positions in U.S. stocks. Here are the top four most shorted U.S. ETFs, according to S3: SPY ETF, $50 billion in short interest. PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), $16.5 billion in short interest. iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWM), $15.6 billion in short interest. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM), $5.6 billion in short interest. Recent Short Seller Targets: Overall, Dusaniwsky said traders have been ramping up diversified exposure to tech stocks in the past month. “Tech stocks, which have been the backbone of this year’s rally, have been cooling off recently and short sellers are looking for exposure to the sector rather than throwing darts and hoping to pick the individual securities that are poised for a pullback,” he said. Here are the four ETFs with the highest increases in short interest in the past 30 days: IWM ETF, +$1.2 billion. QQQ ETF, +$1.1 billion. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK), +$349.3 million. iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:HYG), +$340.4 million. Short Covering ETFs: But while short sellers are generally leaning into the market sell-off, some ETFs have also been experiencing heavy short covering as well. Here are the ETFs with the largest drops in short interest in the past 30 days: SPY ETF, -$3.7 billion. iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (BATS:IEFA), -$383 million.

What Are Currency ETFs? ETFs are exchange-traded funds. An ETF is an investment fund that trades on a stock exchange along with stocks for individual companies. For example, the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) is an ETF that represents 100 of the largest companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq. Currency ETFs give investors the ability to trade the currencies of countries around the globe. Currency exchange-traded funds are popular with forex investors and those keen on the political stances of nations and interest rates. Currency ETFs are popular in the world of forex trading. If you’re interested in investing long in the U.S. dollar, you might consider the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP). Given the UUP ETF is long the US Dollar, UUP in turn shorts those nations that have trade relations with the U.S., such as the Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. This week we posed the following question: over the next five years, which currency ETF will have the largest percentage gain? Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund Invesco CurrencyShares Euro Currency Trust Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust Best Currency ETF A majority of respondents, 53.5%, told us the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund would be the currency ETF that sees the largest gain by 2025. 25.6% of readers said the Invesco CurrencyShares Euro Currency Trust, an ETF that tracks the price of the euro, would experience the largest gain over the next five years. Respondents were the least confident on the future of the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust, which received 20.9% of the support in this week’s study.

However, history suggests that tech stocks could rebound to new highs in 2021 according to UBS analysis, reports the Financial Times. UBS Investment Thesis: According to investment research firm UBS, trading patterns of the last five years show that mid-cycle corrections in global tech stocks lasted an average of a month from peak to trough, and the sector lost up to 11%. The scale of rebound over the next six months was an average 20%. 2020 has been a volatile year for stocks due to the coronavirus pandemic. Even after the 5.7% decline in September and 7.7% decline in March, the Nasdaq 100 index is up 30% in 2020. Applying a similar pattern to Nasdaq 100, following its fall in September, the index could hit new record highs by spring 2021, according to UBS. Despite this, the analysis also suggests the need for diversification — due to choppy September trading. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that investors with exposure to the most expensive tech stocks should rebalance their portfolios to take advantage of upswing stemming from tech enablers, cloud computing, Big Data, and 5G. Bullish view: Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) is up 29.02% year-to-date after falling 9.40% in September. Many investors are still bullish on the sector despite the volatility, according to FT. ""Our fundamental view on the sector has not changed; we are positive on the tech sector . . .

Up 54.13% over the past year, QQQ is extending a lengthy run of outperforming the S&P 500. Additionally, QQQ is a member of the $100 billion club, a claim just four other ETFs can make. Year to date, QQQ added $15.33 billion in new assets, a total surpassed by just four other ETFs. In other words, QQQ is an obvious success story and it should spur some sequels. Those arrived Tuesday when Invesco launched four new funds inspired by QQQ. One of the new products is the Invesco Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (IVNQX), which is targeted at investors that own retirement accounts where ETFs aren't eligible for inclusion. With that in mind, let's have a look at the three new ETFs related to the venerable QQQ. Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) The Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQM) is the cost-effective version of QQQ. Not that QQQ is all that expensive at 0.20% per year, or $20 on a $10,000 investment, the new QQQM does better, charging 0.15% on an annual basis. For buy-and-hold investors with multi-year time horizons, QQQM should be the preferred option because, over time, that annual five basis points in savings will add up. This new ETF represents a strategy other issuers previously used with plenty of success: Create a cheaper version of a popular ETF beloved by professional investors rather than lowing the fee on the institutionally favored product, Invesco NASDAQ-100 Growth Leaders Portfolio (QQQG) The Invesco NASDAQ-100 Growth Leaders Portfolio (NASDAQ:QQQG) is an actively managed fund (QQQ is passive) and unique in that focuses on the 25 Nasdaq-100 companies deemed to have the best growth prospects. In other words, this is an actively managed large-cap growth fund. None of the fund's components exceed weights of 4.1% and the roster includes familiar fare, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Fund (QQQJ) The Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Fund (NASDAQ:QQQJ) tracks the NASDAQ Next Generation 100 Index, which is comprised of the 100 stocks next up to join the Nasdaq-100. QQQJ is similar to another new ETF, which is having a fair amount of success, though the competing strategy focuses on 50 stocks, not 100. Currently, QQQJ holds 97 stocks, 46% of which are technology names. Familiar stocks in this new ETF include Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN). QQQJ also charges 0.15% per year.

"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 09:00:22 -0400",QQQ Minor League ETF Has Major League Potential Of Its Own,"The $138.78 billion Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) is a rock star among exchange-traded funds, being one of the largest and frequently notching returns in excess of other broad market funds. What Happened: With those points in mind, it's not surprising that some other ETFs will seek inspiration from the juggernaut that is QQQ. Invesco brought four such funds to market last week, including the Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Fund (NASDAQ:QQQJ). The newly minted QQQJ tracks the NASDAQ Next Generation 100 Index, which is essentially the minor league for the 100 stocks closest to joining the NASDAQ1-100 Index (NDX), QQQ's underlying benchmark. Why It's Important: There's obvious enthusiasm for the concept as QQQJ already has nearly $69 million in assets under management, an impressive sum for a week's worth of work, but there's more to the story. Both of the aforementioned indexes are cap-weighted, meaning QQQJ's lineup as measured by average market capitalization is far smaller than QQQ's. That's actually good news because the new Invesco ETF can be used as an alternative to traditional mid-cap funds and data confirm that's a good strategy to consider. “As of September 30, 2020: price returns of 271% (not quite as high as Nasdaq-100, but not far behind the Nasdaq Composite/similar to Nasdaq Q-50),” said Nasdaq Global Indexes regarding the performance of QQQJ's benchmark back tested to December 17, 2010. Over that period, the NASDAQ Next Generation 100 Index trounced the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. What's Next: QQQJ can also act as a complement to QQQ for multiple reasons, including varying sector exposures. The new ETF is likely to consistently have lower weights to tech stocks than the large-cap, tech-heavy QQQ. Additionally, QQQJ has “much higher exposure to Health Care and Industrials (37% combined),” notes Nasdaq. “Compared to midcap benchmarks, much lower exposure in Basic Materials/Utilities/Financials/Oil & Gas.” QQQJ also offers other perks when measured against traditional mid-cap ETFs, including a more research and development-intensive roster. Within the rookie ETF, “patent exposure metrics better than midcap benchmarks as well, with 38% of index constituents registering patent activity in one or more Disruptive Tech sub-themes over a recent 12-month period,” notes Nasdaq. QQQJ is also cost-effective. It charges 0.15% per year, or $15 on a $10,000 investment. Among mid-cap growth ETFs, that's one of the lowest expense ratios.

""Although once a result is known, the market tends to see a return to positive performance regardless of which party wins, even if the incumbent party doesn’t retain the White House.” Pictured: Profile chart of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures Technical Broad-market equity indices ended the week lower with the S&P 500 retracing nearly 100% of the rally that began after the September sell-off. During Last Week’s Action: Alongside a materialization of the Federal Reserve's growth risk factors -- a lack of fiscal support, the resurgence of the COVID-19 coronavirus, as well as a tightening of financial conditions -- U.S. index products showed increased confidence in their exploration lower. Going back, last week started off with a clear break from balance and acceptance below the October 22 excess low, which suggested a change in directional conviction. The selling intensified, after a failed response at the $3,370 high-volume concentration, and continued into Friday’s close, through the $3,330 level, which marked the upper boundary of a low-volume concentration, initially formed by upside directional conviction. Given Friday’s end-of-day rotation, away from value, the week ended within a two-day balance area, providing a clear trading framework for the week that follows. Therefore, if participants were to initiate and spend time outside of the balance area, then it's likely the market will continue in that particular direction. Otherwise, prices will remain range-bound, favoring short-term, responsive trade. Fundamental Alongside a resurgence of the COVID-19 coronavirus, in a commentary, Bloomberg discussed the notion that the fear of contagion is more impactful on the economy. In support is the following statement by Variant Perception, an independent economic research provider. “As long as policymakers and the media present a more alarmist view of the virus’s impact than can be justified by a dispassionate analysis of the data, recoveries will continue to stutter. On the other hand, an easing of the fear portrayed would likely allow recoveries to accelerate at a much faster rate.” Continuing, Moody’s Capital Markets Research finds that medical professionals claim a second COVID-19 wave will not exact the same toll on hospitalizations and deaths. With that, Bloomberg adds that the focus on mandatory lockdowns is overdone since the mere idea of catching the deadly virus invokes voluntary social distancing, which has a greater impact on mobility than the lockdowns. This is validated by IMF data which found that the lifting of the lockdowns generally had a more limited impact than imposing one. As a result, Variant Perception suggests that negative coverage of COVID-19 be lightened. Key Events Monday: Markit Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing, Construction Spending, Presidential Election.

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The third quarter of 2020 was an overall solid quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling heading into the holiday shopping season. Fund managers were dumping FANG stocks in the first quarter with a handful of exceptions. For example, Cooperman bought Alphabet. PG&E was one stock several fund managers were playing in the quarter. Tepper and Klarman were buying while Soros was selling. Buffett was aggressively buying health care stocks ahead of Joe Biden’s election victory. Bank stocks were popular among fund managers in the quarter, with most managers selling rather than buying. Cooperman sold JPMorgan, Buffett sold JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and bought Bank of America, and Soros sold Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Eingorn sold the GDX gold miners ETF and bought the GLD gold ETF. Soros made a big bet on tech stocks by buying the QQQ ETF and dumping the IGSB corporate bond fund. Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

Cooperman sold JPMorgan, Buffett sold JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and bought Bank of America, and Soros sold Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Eingorn sold the GDX gold miners ETF and bought the GLD gold ETF. Soros made a big bet on tech stocks by buying the QQQ ETF and dumping the IGSB corporate bond fund. Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

What Is Rebalancing? S&P Global and Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ:NDAQ) adjust the constituents of their popular S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices on a regular basis. New stocks that meet the market cap and profitability requirements are added to the indices, and companies that drop below the threshold for inclusion are removed. The S&P 500 index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, while the Nasdaq 100 is rebalanced annually. This December, the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 will be rebalancing prior to the market open on Monday, Dec. 21.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will join the S&P 500 on Monday, replacing Apartment Investment and Management Co (NYSE:AIV). What To Expect: Tesla will be by far the largest company ever added to the market cap-weighted S&P 500. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) had an initial weighting of around 1.4% when it was added to the index back in 2010, similar to the 1.5% weighting Tesla will have when it joins the index as its sixth-largest component on Monday. Tesla’s $590-billion market cap today dwarfs Berkshire’s $160-billion market cap at the time of its addition. Given so many institutional investors and funds track the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, the rebalancing could trigger some extreme buying and selling volume, especially when it pertains to Tesla. “This is important because if you’re trading these stocks ... to understand that if they are going in or out, there’s going to be some wicked moves in them on Friday,” said Dennis Dick, co-host of Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep. “Maybe that gets you to a target. Maybe that gets you out of something or into something. Maybe there’s some buying pressure that will get you out of your swing trade.” Given the volatility associated with the rebalancing, Dick said traders should always pay attention to the stocks going in and out of major indices. Benzinga’s Take: Traders should watch out for extreme volatility in the specific stocks mentioned and in both the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) on Friday and Monday. Make no mistake about it, Tesla will be the headline given its 768% surge in the last year and the fact that it will be forcing roughly $83.1 billion of buying volume from indexers such as Fidelity and Vanguard.","What Traders Need To Know About The Historic S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 Rebalancing.

Think the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSE:VTI), Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) or, in the fixed income department, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE:AGG). While that asset allocators' affinity for boring ETFs isn't likely to change, 2020 may go down as the year that it was hip to embrace thematic funds. Combine the reputation for outperformance by these ETFs and younger investors' willingness to go thematic, and it's safe to say these funds are just getting going when it comes to adding new assets. As of late in the third quarter, there was nearly $72 billion allocated to U.S.-listed thematic ETFs, more than quadruple the level seen six years earlier. “In the last five years, thematic ETF assets under management (AUM) have grown 25% annually, well above the 17% rate for total equity assets,” notes WisdomTree. Plenty of thematic ETFs will enter 2021 with the potential to shine. Here's a trio to consider. WisdomTree Growth Leaders Fund (PLAT) The premise behind the WisdomTree Growth Leaders Fund (NYSE:PLAT) is simple. PLAT, which is higher by 59% year-to-date, is comprised of high octane companies with platform-based business models, such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Many PLAT companies can be seen as “modern monopolies” and nearly all of the ETF's components fit the bill as a disruptive purveyors of seismic change in their respective industries. Both traits are positives for long-term investors. “Our expectation is for platforms to disrupt competitive landscapes, and to gain market share at the expense of traditional, linear businesses — while doing so with better economies of scale and potential for long-term profitability,” according to WisdomTree. “PLAT can replace or complement both active and passive growth-oriented investment strategies.” Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (BETZ) One of the true success stories among this year's crop of new ETFs, the Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (NYSE:BETZ) is a prime example of a thematic ETF entering 2021 with an array of tailwinds. BETZ debuted in early June and has already returned 62.39% while accumulating $200 million in assets under management. Buoyed by Wall Street's seemingly undaunted enthusiasm for sports wagering equities, BETZ enters 2021 with multiple catalysts, namely increased legalization of iGaming and sports betting by cash-strapped states. Near-term sparks could arrive via New York signing off on mobile betting and Massachusetts signaling sports betting will be addressed and passed in the 2021 legislative session. Adding to the case for BETZ in 2021 is that the new year will be the first full year of sports wagering in new “live and legal” states, such as Colorado, Illinois, Michigan and Tennessee. The sports calendar should normalize in the back half of the year. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF) already more than doubled this year, meaning asking for a sequel in 2021 borders on the greedy, but that doesn't mean investors should gloss over ARKF. It's a time when bitcoin is surging, cashless payments are taking more market share and digital wallets are deeply undervalued. As companies such as Square (NYSE:SQ), ARKF's top holding, further monetize digital wallets, the future is bright for this actively managed ETF. “We believe that Square’s (SQ) Cash App could become a leading global consumer financial services provider,” according to ARK research. “If Cash App can monetize 20% of its US user base at the level of traditional banks today, then with modest growth in its seller business, SQ could return 19% at an annual rate during the next five years, rising from $150 today to $375 per share in 2025.”","3 Thematic ETFs Demanding Investor Attention In 2021.

"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 16:00:39 -0400",Tilson: Frothy Stock Market Could Still Be 'One To Two Years From The Top',"A growing number of investors and analysts are becoming concerned about the stock market’s steep valuations and the frothy trading in a number of tech stocks. Just because the market has a stretched valuation doesn’t mean it can’t go higher — and it doesn’t mean the rally is nearing an end. Economist John Maynard Keynes once said, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” On Tuesday, former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said the stock market is looking a lot like it did during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. Yet traders who sell or short the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) or the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) now could still miss out on some huge gains. Related Link: History Suggests ARK Innovation Investors Should Be Careful, Ritholtz Portfolio Manager Says The state of the market is reminiscent of early 1999, Tilson said — a time when stock prices were getting extremely bloated. Yet the Nasdaq still didn’t ultimately peak until March 2020. In the meantime, it more than doubled from its already overvalued level. From Questionable To Crazy: Tilson said rational value investors are right to be getting uneasy about the trading action in the market, especially in frothy areas such as electric vehicle stocks, SPACs and IPOs. But during the peaks of market bubbles, questionable investor behavior tends to cross over into full-fledged insanity. “In my experience as an investor for more than two decades, when I start to worry, we're one to two years from the top,” Tilson said. “And when I think things can't possibly get any crazier, we're still six months to a year from the top!” At this point, Tilson said he is yet to see anything approaching the behavior he witnessed in the spring of 2000. Benzinga’s Take: There’s certainly nothing wrong with starting to take profits in frothy stocks or looking to dial back exposure to the tech sector after its huge run. But shorting the market at this point can be a dangerous game given that frenzied retail buyers have utter disregard for valuations, and they may be nowhere near the end of their buying spree.","Tilson: Frothy Stock Market Could Still Be 'One To Two Years From The Top'. A growing number of investors and analysts are becoming concerned about the stock market’s steep valuations and the frothy trading in a number of tech stocks. Just because the market has a stretched valuation doesn’t mean it can’t go higher — and it doesn’t mean the rally is nearing an end. Economist John Maynard Keynes once said, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” On Tuesday, former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said the stock market is looking a lot like it did during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. Yet traders who sell or short the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) or the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) now could still miss out on some huge gains.

"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 18:39:41 -0400",4 ETFs To Watch In 2021,"In the exchange traded funds industry, records are seemingly always being shattered and that's the case again in 2021. As of Dec. 17, $509.4 billion flowed into ETFs this year, topping the previous annual record of $476.1 billion notched in 2017. Record flows of fixed income ETFs in 2020? Check. Record adoption of environmental, social and governance ETFs? Check. Two more fun facts: The rates of ETF closures and new product launches this year are also new highs. All of that is to say a lot is happening with ETFs this year, and it's not a stretch to say investors can expect more of the same in 2021. On that note, here is an admittedly small group of ETFs investors should keep up with in 2021. The group addresses some of the trends that could take center stage in the new year, including enthusiasm for bonds, ongoing affinity for ESG strategies and the growth/value chasm. SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF (SPYV) For years, there's been talk of a value resurgence and more often than not, it proved to be just idle chatter as growth stocks are dominating for the better part of a decade. This time could be different: President-Elect Joe Biden is seen as a positive catalyst for value stocks. The SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSE:SPYV) is up more than 14% in the fourth quarter, indicating the fund is getting some love from Election Day results. SPYV, which tracks the S&P 500 Value Index, is a bet on a post-pandemic economic recovery due to its cyclical leanings. Financial services and industrial stocks combine for 31% of the ETF's roster. Part of thesis here revolves around the oft-cited anecdote that the valuation gap between growth and value is as wide as it's ever been, but it remains to be seen if that's a credible spark for SPYV in 2021. Note there are dozens of large-cap value ETFs for investors to consider. SPYV is highlighted here because it tracks a well-known index. With its annual fee of just 0.04%, or $4 on a $10,000 investment, it's one of the cheapest funds in this category. Invesco QQQ (QQQ) Speaking of the growth/value rivalry, one of the premier avenues for playing the mega-cap growth side of the equation is the Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ). QQQ, famed for tracking the Nasdaq-100 Index, garnered $17.23 billion of inflows this year as of Dec. 24. Just two ETFs top that total. Helped by above-average weights to the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), QQQ has a long track record of topping competing S&P 500 ETFs and crushing value ETFs in the process. An overlooked benefit of QQQ is that it provides significant exposure to companies behind some of the world's most valuable brands, and that's meaningful for investors. “Brand management can hold the key to financial performance in many respects. After all, consumers will go with what they trust and know; brands with such recognition and pull are in a constant position to succeed,” according to Nasdaq research. “As such, a bevy of Nasdaq-100 companies were recognized as among BrandZ's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands 2020.” ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) The ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (CBOE: ARKG) is the thematic inclusion on this list and a worthy one at that. Obviously, ARKG hails from the famed stable of ARK actively managed ETFs, and it's one of just two that doesn't feature a substantial allocation to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). By some accounts, companies engaged in DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence and gene therapies have the potential to be the next generation of FANG stocks. That's an audacious thesis, but ARKG has myriad long-term catalysts, including the evolution of precision medicine and declining genomics costs. ARKG has outperformed the S&P 500 Health Care Index in three of the past four years and by substantial margins. VanEck Vectors Green Bond ETF (GRNB) The smallest of the funds highlighted here, the VanEck Vectors Green Bond ETF (NYSE:GRNB) is important because it represents a growing intersection between ESG and the bond market. Specifically, the “E” because green bonds are debt issued to fund environmentally friendly projects. Consider GRNB as ESG bond play with growth benefits and some positive leverage to the incoming Biden administration. “The U.S. green bond market is far from where it should be based on the size of its bond market, and even further from where it needs to be to finance a transition to a low carbon economy,” writes William Sokol, senior ETF product manager at VanEck. “There is hope that President-elect Biden’s administration could help spur U.S. green finance and investment, including green bonds.” Todd Shriber owns shares of ARKG.","4 ETFs To Watch In 2021.

"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 19:31:14 -0400","What Burst The Dot-Com Bubble, And Will It Happen Again In 2021?","One of the biggest questions for investors going into 2021 is whether the markets are in another tech bubble similar to the dot-com bubble back in 2000. On Tuesday, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas said there are plenty of similarities between the tech sector in 1999 and the tech sector in 2020, but there is one key difference that could keep stock prices rising. Colas pointed out that SPACs and EV stocks are behaving a lot like the speculative tech stocks of 1999. In addition, the Nasdaq is up 94% over the last two years, roughly in-line with its one-year gain of 86% in 1999. The Federal Reserve’s Role: Colas said there is one key difference between 1999 and 2020 when it comes to the Federal Reserve. The Fed recently reiterated its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases to provide liquidity to the market. Interest rates are at zero, and the latest Fed projections call for them to stay there through at least 2023. Turn back the clock to 2000 and you get a completely different picture. By March 2000, interest rates had risen to 5.85%, roughly in-line with their previous cyclical peak in 1995. “The tech sector began to roll over as soon as it became clear that the Fed was intent on taking short term interest rates to new cycle-high levels and cooling the booming US economy,” Colas said. The Nasdaq peaked on March 10, 2000, but the Fed continued to raise interest rates another 0.5% from there before finally easing in late 2000. Colas said the Fed’s more dovish approach to markets in 2021 doesn’t necessarily mean tech-heavy ETFs like the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) will outperform in 2021. It just may take a different catalyst to turn the tech tide this time around. Benzinga’s Take: Identifying financial market bubbles is much more difficult than predicting just how inflated they will get and exactly when they will pop. One of the best ways to protect your portfolio from potential fallout from a stock market bubble is by diversifying into different market sectors and asset classes and maintaining a comfortable level of cash in your account to take advantage of any potential buying opportunities that may emerge if the stock market goes south.","What Burst The Dot-Com Bubble, And Will It Happen Again In 2021?.
