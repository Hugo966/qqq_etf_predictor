"Sat, 02 Jan 2021 13:08:43 -0400",3 New ETFs For 2021: Rookies Ready To Come Of Age,"Rarely is it a dull year in the exchange traded funds industry and 2020 was no exception. Among the many records set last year in ETF Land were closures and launches. First, the bad news. As Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas points out in some recent posts, as of Dec. 28, 253 ETFs closed in 2020. That's a record and more than double the closure level seen in 2019, but that is the sign of a hyper-competitive, maturing industry. Just because an issuer builds it (an ETF) doesn't they (investors) will come. The better news is that more than 300 new ETFs, just in the U.S., debuted last year, up from 219 the previous year. Balchunas recently posted some interesting footnotes about the top 20 by assets. First, Vanguard isn't on that list because it didn't introduce any new products last year. Second, some nuanced products from smaller issuers rapidly accumulated assets. Third, as Balchunas notes, just 36 rookie ETFs amassed more than $100 million in assets last year and just one topped $1 billion. Here, we'll examine three of 2020's new ETFs that could be in for big things this year for reasons that go beyond their assets under management. JPMorgan BetaBuilders U.S. Mid Cap Equity ETF (BBMC) Yes, some of the smaller though still successful rookie ETFs will be highlighted here, but the JPMorgan BetaBuilders U.S. Mid Cap Equity ETF (NYSE:BBMC) deserves attention, too, because this is the only new one of 2020's new ETFs that has over $1 billion in assets. To be precise, BBMC is a $1.34 billion fund following its April 14 debut. JPMorgan was a late entrant to the ETF business, but thanks to a robust distribution network and the ability to bring its own assets, it's a rapidly growing issuer. Those benefits are trickling down to BBMC — the mid-cap fund is now the issuer's seventh-largest ETF. Besides those superficial superlatives, BBMC is up 61% since inception. Buoyed by mid-cap earnings momentum, the new JPMorgan ETF could shine again next year. “We expect the Russell Midcap Index to post a sizable earnings-per-share increase, which should support our 2021 year-end median price target for the index of 2,700,” according to Wells Fargo. Cabana Target Drawdown 10 ETF (TDSC) The Cabana Target Drawdown 10 ETF (NYSE:TDSC) is part of a broader suite of five ETFs launched by Cabana Group in May — another is on the top 20 list in terms of assets added by new ETFs. As of Dec. 29, TDSC had $552.28 million in assets under management, a total surpassed by just five other new ETFs. TDSC is an ETF of ETFs that's designed to protect investors against equity market swoons while still providing ample opportunity for upside capture. There's a hefty dose of income as four of the new fund's holdings include Treasury, corporate debt — investment-grade and junk — and preferred stock ETFs. Other holdings include the Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLY). Global X Telemedicine & Digital Health ETF (EDOC) Just seven new ETFs, including the aforementioned BBMC and TDSC, have accumulated more assets this year than the Global X Telemedicine & Digital Health ETF (NASDAQ:EDOC). EDOC debuted on July 29 and now has a tidy $564.17 million in assets, speaking to investors enthusiasm for thematic ETFs. EDOC is benefiting from the duel tailwinds of that thirst for thematic investments and the coronavirus pandemic hastening adoption of digital health practices. On the other hand, both of those catalysts could expire next year. Fortunately, that won't weigh on EDOC because telemedicine was growing prior to the pandemic and is forecast to do so after COVID-19 is a thing of the past. EDOC is up 24.15% in just five months on the market. Photo courtesy: Joe Mabel via Wikimedia","3 New ETFs For 2021: Rookies Ready To Come Of Age.

"Sun, 03 Jan 2021 12:06:22 -0400","Will Tesla, Apple and Amazon Help The QQQ ETF Reach $400 By 2022?","Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. We surveyed a group of over 500 investors on whether the Invesco QQQ Index ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) will reach $400 by 2022. What Are ETFs? ETF stands for exchange-traded fund. An ETF is an investment fund whose shares trade on a stock exchange just like stocks for individual companies. ETFs track an index or sector, represent a commodity (like gold, oil or wheat) or sample a basket of stocks or bonds that meet given criteria. Exchange-traded funds are popular with investors given they can help mitigate risk in a portfolio. The QQQ ETF tracks the NASDAQ 100, which includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange based on market capitalization. The fund and the index are rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted annually. With 48% of QQQ’s weighted allocation stemming from the information technology sector, it’s no surprise that after hitting a 2020 low of $165 in March, QQQ closed 2020 just shy of $314. As of publishing, QQQ’s five largest holdings are Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) (13.39% of allocation), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) (10.76%), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) (10.66%), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ:FB) (4.26%) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) (3.45%). QQQ Forecast 2021 In our survey, 63% of Benzinga traders and investors said the QQQ ETF would reach $400 by the end of 2021. Being that QQQ representation is heavily dependent on and allocated towards tech, healthcare and consumer services, investors told us they believe the ETF will grow alongside an improving US economy in 2021, as well as a continued surge in demand and interest for the ETF’s most popular stocks — Tesla, Apple and Amazon. Respondents also believe QQQ will see strength throughout 2021 given that the sector allocation of the ETF’s NASDAQ-100 representation is dominated by information technology (48%), communication services (19%) and consumer discretionary (19%) stocks. If the US economy were to improve throughout 2021, it can be said that information techology, communication services and consumer discretionary sectors stand to gain the most in the coming months. See Also: Blue Chip Stocks. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in December 2020 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults.","Will Tesla, Apple and Amazon Help The QQQ ETF Reach $400 By 2022?.

"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 14:50:17 -0400",Simplify ETFs Continues Torrid Launch Pace With 4 Disruptive Thematic Funds (One Heavy On Tesla),"The universe of thematic exchange-traded funds continues expanding as upstart issuer Simply Asset Management extends its brisk pace of product launches with a quartet of rookie funds focusing on various disruptive technologies. What Happened: Simplify launched its initial trio of ETFs featuring options overlay strategies in September followed by a pair of similar products last month. Now it's getting thematic with cloud/cybersecurity, fintech, pop culture and robocar ETFs. The launches could prove well-timed because, as 2020 proved, ETF users are embracing thematic and disruptive funds and returns are justifying that faith. “The pace of technological disruption is faster than ever. Nimbler, tech-savvy companies are pulling ahead of slower peers in an increasingly winner-take-all market,” according to Simplify. “The best firms are not just disrupting existing industries but creating brand-new ones. Firms able to deliver growth in a slow-growth world command premium valuation.” The Simplify Volt Robocar Disruption and Tech ETF (NYSE:VCAR) is one of the new Simplify ETFs. Investors may love VCAR for a simple reason: It's heavy on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The new ETF allocates almost 15% of its weight to that stock with a 10% options overlay. The Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) and the Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQJ) combine for over 69% of VCAR's equity exposure. Why It's Important: Fintech is one of the most compelling disruptive investment niches, but there are just a handful of ETFs addressing it. Add one more in the form of the Simplify Volt Fintech Disruption ETF (NYSE:VFIN). That new ETF is heavy on Lemonade (NASDAQ:LMND) and Square (NYSE:SQ) as each fintech name represents about 20% of VFIN's weight, each with a 5% options overlay. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are among the other familiar names in the new ETF. A Simplify fund that could appeal to younger investors is the Simplify Volt Pop Culture Disruption (NYSE:VPOP). VPOP is a new media concept, but it's not heavy on old guard social media names. Rather, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) are the fund's two largest holdings and each features an options component as is the case with the top holdings in the other ETFs mentioned here. What's Next: Although there are dedicated cloud computing and cybersecurity ETFs on the market, the new Simplify Volt Cloud and Cybersecurity Disruption ETF (NYSE:VCLO) is unique in that it marries both disruptive technologies under the umbrella of a single ETF. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) combine for 42% of VCLO with each of those name garnering 2.5% call option positions.","Simplify ETFs Continues Torrid Launch Pace With 4 Disruptive Thematic Funds (One Heavy On Tesla).

In fact, the whole idea is to prevent any such anxiety. Stock markets, exchanges and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are authorized to suspend trading on individual securities to protect investors and level the field between informed, reactive traders and those lagging on relevant news. Halts may occur if a stock fails to meet regulatory requirements, in advance of price-moving company announcements, or to correct an imbalance from inordinately heavy volumes. Classified as “regulatory” or “nonregulatory,” each halt is labeled with a code indicating its circumstances. For example, T1 indicates a halt with news pending, T2 a halt with news released, H4 a halt due to non-compliance with listing requirements, and H10 a halt imposed by the SEC. Regulatory Halts When companies go public, they agree to provide affiliated stock markets advanced notice of price-busting news, such as significant changes in finances or management, restructurings, mergers or product updates. The markets evaluate corporate reports and determine whether the potential impact merits a halt. They can also suspend trading on already public information or in response to major events beyond corporate control, such as business-affecting natural disasters. Related Link: The T-12 Nasdaq Halt: When Stocks Get Called To The Principal’s Office Other markets trading the security are obliged to enforce concurrent pauses. The authorizing halter will reopen trading based on its own assessment, at which time all other listings can resume. Market authorities can also halt trading if there are concerns over a security’s compliance with listing standards. The SEC, for example, can suspend stock activity for up to 10 trading days if it registers risk to the investing public based on a variety of factors, including suspected stock manipulation and poor timeliness or quality of a firm’s required filings. Non-Regulatory Halts Some halts will automatically occur when a security hits its daily trading limit and expends its allotted trading contracts for a particular session. These limits safeguard from extreme volatility. Additionally, if a company announces significant news after trading closes, exchanges might then delay the opening of the security the next day to correct imbalances from off-hour orders. These halts are not obligatorily enforced on peripheral markets. Non-regulatory halts are exclusive to exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and cannot be imposed by stock markets, such as the Nasdaq. For this reason, Nasdaq halts are known always to precede announcements, while NYSE halts may merely signal high volatility. While most volatility-based halts are stock-specific, there are also market-wide circuit breakers, which are approved by the SEC to prevent volatility-inspired panic trading. Circuit breakers, or “collars,” were first imposed after the 1987 market crash and now occur when prices hit predetermined thresholds. The length of suspension depends on the percentage of movement and the time of occurrence. The Implications While a security is halted, brokers cannot publish quotations or indications of interest, but not all activity is inaccessible. Investors can cancel open orders or partake in options trading.

With stock market valuations getting more bloated by the week, there are plenty of skeptics that believe certain stocks and sectors have come too far too fast. There is currently $244 billion in aggregate domestic ETF short interest, according to S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky. Over the past month, Dusaniwsky said short sellers have increased their exposure by about $14 billion. Related Link: Here's Where To Look For A Short Squeeze In The Reopening Restaurant Space As of Wednesday, here are the six most heavily shorted domestic ETFs: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), $60.5 billion in short interest. iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWM), $20.9 billion in short interest. PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), $19.7 billion in short interest. iShares iBoxx $ High Yid Corp Bond (NYSE:HYG), $11 billion in short interest. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Indx (NYSE: EEM 2.12%, $9.5 billion in short interest. SPDR S&P Biotech (NYSE:XBI), $7.9 billion in short interest. Short Percent Of Float: By far the most heavily shorted ETF is the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 and represents a simple bet against the U.S. stock market and/or a hedge against long positions in U.S. stocks. In the past 30 days, SPY short interest has increased by $4.8 billion. When it comes to short percent of float, however, the XBI Biotech ETF has the highest of the six ETFs mentioned above at 94%. While it didn’t crack the top six, Dusaniwsky said the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE:XOP) has seen the largest percent increase in short interest so far in 2021. XOP short increase is up 27% to $2.6 billion year-to-date. At the same time, short sellers have been jumping ship on the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE:AGG). AGG fund short interest is down 42% year-to-date to $1.9 billion. Here are the six ETFs with at least $25 million in short interest that have the highest short percent of float, according to S3: SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT), 195% of float.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell greased the slide with predictions of increased inflation in the near future. What Happened in Washington: Powell, speaking Thursday at the virtual Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit, glumly predicted that inflation would uptick in the next few months, but not enough to warrant the central bank’s changing the historically low interest rates it has maintained. “We do expect that as the economy reopens and hopefully picks up, we'll see inflation move up,” said Powell in an interview. “Compared to the economic scenarios we contemplated a year ago, it's good to see where we are.” Powell offered a reminder that “for several decades, the U.S. and world economy has been in a low inflation world.” While insisting the Fed believes the nation will face “a transitory increase in inflation” he stressed the Fed would not abruptly change course in response. “I expect that we will be patient,” he said. “There’s a difference between a one-time surge in prices and ongoing inflation.” See Also: February Retail Sales Rise 4.6%, Online Sales Soar 54.7%: Key Takeaways Powell offered an assurance that the Fed would not rush to change its policies as the economy regains its strength. “There’s reason to think that we’ll begin to make more progress, soon,” he said. “But even if that happens, as now seems likely, it will take some time to achieve ‘substantial’ further progress.” What Happened on Wall Street: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.1% at 30,924.14, while the NASDAQ Composite was down 2.11% to close at 12,723.47. Among the major exchange-traded funds, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was down 1.24% to 376.70 while the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was down 1.64% to close at 304.09. While the markets reacted negatively to his comments, the 10-year U.S. government bond yield responded positively and recorded a 0.07% upswing to 1.54% by the closing bell. What's Next: ""It is clear that the bond market is pricing in greater inflation on the back of economic reflation this year,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP. ""Powell’s statement in our opinion, and its FAIT policy regime is predicated, on the notion that the structural transformation of the economy over the past two decades has a modest disinflationary bias which gives the monetary and fiscal authority greater degrees of freedom when it comes to accommodate shocks to the economy."" ""From our vantage point,"" Brusuelas continued, ""we think that the optimal action in coming weeks or months may be “Operation Twist III” where the Fed sells treasuries in its portfolio at the front end of the curve, then take the proceeds and purchases bonds at the long end of the curve to damp long term rates, in order to address what market moves that are out of line with economic fundamentals.""

The company is going to report earnings on Tuesday and Worth thinks the stock is going higher. Microsoft is in an uptrend, but its relative performance to Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) is poor since 2020. Recently, its relative strength improved as the stock broke the downtrend line of its relative performance to QQQ. Worth is a buyer of the stock going into earnings. Mike Khouw wants to use options to make the trade in Microsoft. He wants to buy the July $270 call for $7 and sell the April $270 call for $1.30. The trade would cost him $5.70. He is hoping the stock is going to stay below $270 at the April expiration and then move higher, above $275.70. If the April call expires worthless, Khouw can sell another call to lower the breakeven.

"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:03:30 -0400",Exclusive: Facebook's 'Stock Market For Beginners' Group Blooms From Zero To 40K In 6 Months,"The Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group Stock Market for Beginners went live Oct. 15, 2020. Tony Szymanski was named an administrator in the group last December, when its membership was at 900, but he hardly pretends to be a lifelong expert in investing. “I grew up in a lower income family,” Szymanski said. “I never really had a lot of money. In my early 20s I was buying gas with spare change, and I realized I needed to take control of my finances.” Szymanski studied economics in college, where he took his first literacy course. He said he was able to save his first $10,000 by the time he reached 27 and open a 401(k) account, but it wasn’t until he reached 32 that he made his first stock purchase. “The first thing I ever bought was Ford (NYSE:F),” he said. Now 34 and working as a quality control officer in the aerospace industry, Szymanski sought to share his newfound knowledge of investing with as many people as he could. He teamed with his brother Andrew on ""The Stock Bros Podcast,"" which debuted last December. “We wanted to help people learn financial literacy and teach people how the stock market works and how to invest wisely,” he said. “We’re not necessarily giving any recommendations on what to buy, but we just want people to understand how it works, the terminology and what-not.” While looking for Facebook groups to join as a means of both self-education and self-promotion of the podcast, Szymanski found Stock Market for Beginners. A conversation with group founder Johnny Margarito, a manager at Wisemen Traderz in Albuquerque, New Mexico, led Szymanski from being a quiet observer to a hands-on administrator. See Also: Benzinga's Market Education Portal Signs Of The Times: During the last four months, Stock Market for Beginners’ membership base expanded significantly as investment-related news dominated the headlines, particularly how Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum gave GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) a degree of prominence that stunned the traditional chieftains of Wall Street. Many new members joined the group seeking greater insight into these developments, especially when it came to the alleged ease of instant riches via stock trading. “The biggest mistake that people are trying to make is they're trying to get rich quick,” he said. “They see all these news articles, they see people on Reddit posting pictures of their portfolios, where they're making a couple or hundred or thousand dollars in a day or two. So, they think that they can just come in and start doing that as well.” Szymanski sees the group’s mission as separating information from frenzy, particularly when it comes to the investment sector’s equivalent of bright shiny objects. “We try to get people to avoid jumping on the Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) hype, the AMC and the GameStop, and stuff like that,” he continued. “People don't educate themselves before they start buying — and I was guilty of it, too. People will just start buying things and they don't understand what a limit order is. We're just trying to help people understand those things before they get too deep into making bad decisions.” See Also: Benzinga Stock Market Live: Review The Best SPACs Knowing Where To Go: The current glut of investing advice reminds Szymanski of the fabled remark attributed to the controversial financier Joseph P. Kennedy, who exited Wall Street ahead of the Great Depression by claiming, “If shoe shine boys are giving stock tips, then it's time to get out of the market.” “I don't know if everybody thinks they're an expert, but that definitely could be the case,” he said. “I think they're hearing from their co-workers, from their friends or family who tell them, ‘Hey, you’ve got to start buying Dogecoin or you’ve got to start buying this.’ And once you hear about starting to buy anything, it's probably too late — you have to be one of the people that buys in before it takes off.” As an administrator in the Facebook group, Szymanski asks the membership to consider advice from individuals who have gained respect over the years for their approach to investing. “Obviously, all investments have risks, but my idea of a good investment is passive investing,” he said. “I've read a lot and listen to a lot of videos of people like Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and Ray Dalio. I [like] investing in an index like the S&P 500 or the QQQ which is proven to have a good track record.” Szymanski admitting to having some Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in his portfolio, but he cautioned the Facebook group members about the “alt coins out there that are pump-and-dump schemes where they're getting people to sign up, and once they start amassing a large number of people signing up the initial investors are going to pull their money out. I'm just not a fan a lot of these all currencies, like SafeMoon (CRYPTO: SAFEMOON) and Dogecoin, but I definitely see a future in Bitcoin.” As for the near-term future of Stock Market for Beginners, Szymanski wants to grow the group to 100,000 members by the end of the year and to make it the one-stop shop on Facebook for investing education. “We want to talk about all subjects of the stock market,” he said. “But we also want to keep our core values. We're not trying to rip people off or get people into risky investments. We want everybody to know what they're getting into before they buy anything. So, we will just be preaching wise investing.” See Also: Benzinga Stock Market: Ruell's Report (Banner image of the Stock Market for Beginners group, courtesy Johnny Margarito.)","Exclusive: Facebook's 'Stock Market For Beginners' Group Blooms From Zero To 40K In 6 Months.

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session. On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel. Many investors are wondering why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading in the red after such a stellar earnings report. In reality, it has nothing to do with Microsoft. The reason has everything to do with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and the effects of ETF arbitrage. Alphabet Blows It Away: Just before Microsoft reported results. Alphabet blew the Street away with outstanding results. The company reported quarterly earnings of $26.29 per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $15.88. The company reported quarterly sales of $55.31 billion, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $51.68 billion by 7%. To put the icing on the cake, the company announced the board of directors approved a $50 billion class C capital stock buyback. In the Street’s view, the buybacks show the confidence the company has in its future earnings growth as the stock trades at an all-time high. As expected, shares of Alphabet went into orbit. Index Arbitrage Traders Need To Keep Pace: Keep in mind, the combined Alphabet companies represent 3.81% of the entire S&P 500 index and 6.93% of the Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ), not to mention the other indexes of which it's a large component. As Alphabet shot up following its earnings report, index arbitrage traders were scrambling to purchase shares of the related indexes and sell other stocks in an effort to keep the indices in line with their components. The problem was, in the after-hours market there were only so many offers to lift in the QQQs, and there wasn’t as much liquidity in the index’s other components. This created an arbitrage quagmire. Microsoft Rescues The Arbs: On any other day, Microsoft’s report may have created a buying frenzy in the issue. The company reported quarterly earnings of $1.95 per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.78. The company reported quarterly sales of $41.70 billion, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $41.03 billion. Other market pundits will come up with some other kind of excuse why the issue is in the red, but it's all in the arbitrage math. With Microsoft being 5.56% of the S&P 500 index and 9.5% of the QQQ, arbs realized they could just as easily keep the indexes in-line to account for Alphabet’s rise by selling Microsoft. And that's exactly what happened. This concept is not an easy one to follow and not understood by a large percentage of the investment world. If you listen to Dennis Dick’s dissertation on the subject on Wednesday’s ""PreMarket Prep"" Show, you will gain an uniques perspective on the markets that can another tool in your trading toolbox.","Why Microsoft Is Really Trading Down Today (Hint: It Has Nothing To Do With Earnings).

Microsoft Rescues The Arbs: On any other day, Microsoft’s report may have created a buying frenzy in the issue. The company reported quarterly earnings of $1.95 per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.78. The company reported quarterly sales of $41.70 billion, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $41.03 billion. Other market pundits will come up with some other kind of excuse why the issue is in the red, but it's all in the arbitrage math. With Microsoft being 5.56% of the S&P 500 index and 9.5% of the QQQ, arbs realized they could just as easily keep the indexes in-line to account for Alphabet’s rise by selling Microsoft. And that's exactly what happened. This concept is not an easy one to follow and not understood by a large percentage of the investment world. If you listen to Dennis Dick’s dissertation on the subject on Wednesday’s ""PreMarket Prep"" Show, you will gain an uniques perspective on the markets that can another tool in your trading toolbox.",,

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $338.87. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-04-30 Strike Price: $341.00 Volume: 6264 Open Interest: 7776 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $319.42. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-05-21 Strike Price: $325.00 Volume: 11746 Open Interest: 66695 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

"Wed, 12 May 2021 21:47:52 -0400",That '70s Show: Chaos In The Middle East Plus Gas Lines At Home Suggest It's Time To Play Defense,"Hat tip to James Kirkpatrick for the apposite Simpsons still. Chaos In The Mideast, Gas Lines At Home In our last post (Shades Of 2000 And 2008), we wrote about two observers of the current scene who saw parallels to the spring of 2000 and the summer of 2008, respectively. We'll be checking in again with one of those observers below, but it occurs to us that one could draw another historical analogy here: the 1970s. The '70s famously featured chaos in the Middle East, from the Arab-Israeli War in 1973 to the Iran hostage crisis later in the decade as well as gas lines in the U.S. due to the OPEC boycott. Mideast (and Midwest) Chaos This week, we've had Israelis and Palestinians fighting it out with everything from rocks, to rockets. Meanwhile, supporters of both sides clashed in New York City, And supporters of one side marched in the Midwest of all places, in Minneapolis. Pipeline Problems At the same time, thanks to a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, parts of America's east coast were plagued by gas shortages. As of midnight, Patrick De Haan of Gas Buddy reported that nearly 1,800 gas stations in the Southeast were out of gas. Perhaps because it didn't support the narrative of America improving under its new management, national media didn't spend too much time talking about these shortages. Entrepreneur, investor, and crypto advocate Balaji Srinivasan saw the pipeline problem as another failure of American elites. Up until he decamped recently for Singapore and India, one would have thought Srinivasan was an American elite himself. Readers may recall that the former Andreessen Horowitz partner was mooted as a candidate for FDA chairman last year. Objections To The 1970s Comparison At this point, we can imagine some readers objecting to our 1970s comparison. What about all the tech innovation going on today, you might ask. There was innovation in the 1970s too. Microsoft, Apple, and Genentech were all founded in the '70s. We can also imagine some pointing out that Joe Biden is no Jimmy Carter. This is true. Jimmy Carter was a fairly vigorous 53-year-old in his first year in the White House; Joe Biden, in contrast, is a somewhat less-spry 78. And while Carter presided over the Camp David peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, Biden has so far presided over a deterioration in Arab (Palestinian)-Israeli relations. In this sense, our current situation may be worse. While President Biden has been notably absent from Twitter, he appears to be notably absent from much else too, as Ed Asante pithily suggested. Checking In Again With ""The Flaming Eyeball"" In our previous post, we included an observation passed along by ""The Flaming Eyeball"" that the current economic environment echoed the summer of 2008 with respect to gas prices and intimations of impending doom. Here he offers another astute observation, that the lack of a strong figure in the White House to offer cogent reassurances may make the current chaos worse. Time To Play Defense As our friend ""Hlithskjolf"" says, it's time to play defense. We mentioned one way of playing defense in our previous post: hedging against market risk. In the video below, we present a demonstration of that, for an investor whose portfolio is closely correlated with the Nasdaq. The basic idea is to use the Nasdaq-tracking Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) as a proxy, and then to scan for the optimal put options given your risk tolerance on an appropriate dollar amount of shares.","That '70s Show: Chaos In The Middle East Plus Gas Lines At Home Suggest It's Time To Play Defense.

The stock price moved up to $324.96 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-05-14 Strike Price: $325.00 Volume: 25863 Open Interest: 19648 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

The stock price moved up to $337.97 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-06-14 Strike Price: $337.00 Volume: 472 Open Interest: 658 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $342.69. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-06-25 Strike Price: $338.00 Volume: 668 Open Interest: 672 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 14:48:27 -0400",PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Amazon,"Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session. On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel. There are obvious catalysts to move an issue higher, such as an earnings beat or an upgrade by a Wall Street analyst. Then there can be the not so obvious one such as the time period leading up to a well-publicized event. On June 21-22, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will have Prime Day and the price action leading up to the event makes it the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day. Now That Is A Trading Range: For the most part, Amazon has been in a trading range from $3,000-$3,500 over the past 11 months. The issue has spent very little time under $3,000 and above $3,500. While it usually a slow grind when moving from the extremes, it has had an impressive move over the last nine sessions. Rotation Plays A Role: Certainly one important factor in Amazon’s rally this week has been another round of vicious sector rotation that has been so prevalent over the last few months. The flavor of the past few weeks has been out of the financials and other issues that do better with higher interest rates and into the mega-cap growth technology sector. This divergence is best illustrated by the horrible performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average repelling off its all-time high, while the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) made a new all-time on Thursday powered by big tech. Prime Day: Although it hasn't been in the mainstream media that much this week, it will be all over it next week. News outlets will publicize the billions of dollars that are being raked it repeatedly. All of a sudden, they will focus on how close Amazon is to making a new all-time high. The constant stream of positive comments may lead more investors to go along for the ride. Moving Forward: With the actual event taking place on Monday and Tuesday, there is certainly room for more upside. With the issue performing well in a weak tape in Friday’s session, lower by $6 at $3,483 as of 2:45 p.m. EST, it's hard to predict the rally is close to being over, Also, with the issue now within striking distance of its all-time high ($3,552.25) from September, there may be more upside. From an optimistic point of view, how high could Amazon go if it finally breaks out of its nearly year-long consolidation pattern? Price Don’t Lie: Of course, there is a chance that the opportunistic buyers from the last few weeks are waiting to unload to the latecomers. If one is to take that approach to the rally, then it's imperative to make a new all-time high and just keep going. If not, the late buyers to the issue will be selling into a much more difficult one on the decline as opposed to having your offers being lifted today and perhaps into Monday and Tuesday. The discussion on Amazon from Friday’s show can be found here:","PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Amazon. Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET.

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $344.88. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-06-30 Strike Price: $342.00 Volume: 2260 Open Interest: 7024 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.

""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option.

"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 14:32:22 -0400","Understanding Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1's Unusual Options Activity","Shares of Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $357.98. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-07-16 Strike Price: $360.00 Volume: 28171 Open Interest: 34076 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $360.84. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-12-17 Strike Price: $350.00 Volume: 691 Open Interest: 11146 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $363.66. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-07-14 Strike Price: $364.00 Volume: 52978 Open Interest: 5813 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

On July 16, 1998, the Nasdaq Composite Index closed above 2,000 for the first time. Where The Market Was: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day at 9,328.19 and the S&P 500 traded at 1,183.99. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 1998, France hosted and won the FIFA World Cup. The U.S. redesigned its $20 bills to make them more difficult to counterfeit. Average annual U.S. income was $38,100. Nasdaq Milestone: Almost exactly three years after closing above 1,000 for the first time on July 17, 1995, The Nasdaq Composite eclipsed the 2,000 mark for the first time on July 16, 1998. The surge in tech stocks driven by the dot-com bubble generated major returns for Nasdaq investors in the late 1990s, and the 2,000 mark was nowhere near the peak. The Nasdaq had doubled again before the end of 1999, reaching 4,000 for the first time on December 29. Within three months, the Nasdaq reached 5,000 and hit its dot-com bubble peak of 5,132.52 in early 2000. The party didn’t last for long, however.

The stock price moved down to $353.27 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-07-23 Strike Price: $358.00 Volume: 8159 Open Interest: 2369 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.

Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved up to $363.11 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-09-30 Strike Price: $355.00 Volume: 635 Open Interest: 1686 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.

(NASDAQ:MSFT) has joined Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the stocks seeing the highest interest on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets forum as of Tuesday night. What Happened: Exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) remained the most-discussed stock on the forum with 832 mentions, while tech giant Apple was a distant second with 311 mentions during the last 24 hours, data from Quiver Quantitative showed. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices are in the third and fourth positions, having attracted 278 and 258 mentions on the forum respectively.

"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 14:46:35 -0400","Unusual Options Activity Insight: Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1","Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved up to $367.01 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-07-30 Strike Price: $362.50 Volume: 2540 Open Interest: 2654 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $366.38. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-08-06 Strike Price: $366.00 Volume: 9064 Open Interest: 5456 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.

"Wed, 04 Aug 2021 12:05:16 -0400","PerkinElmer, A Five-Year Analysis: How Important Is Re-Investing Dividends?","Compounding Returns In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future earnings potential. One of the key ways that company earnings find their way into an investor's pocket is through dividends, which are cash or stock payments that represent a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Retained earnings is calculated as: RE = BP + Net Income - Dividends Where BP = Retained Earnings at the beginning of the period. Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NYSE:PKI compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in PKI, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in PKI, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in PKI if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? Dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This is the date by which one must hold a share in order to receive the dividend. Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news. PKI's Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to That Of Index ETFs The plot above shows the evolution of PKI's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for PKI, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. By looking at the price chart of PKI's common stock one can see that price appreciation alone misses a fair bit of value if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $368.78. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-06 Strike Price: $369.00 Volume: 15278 Open Interest: 48775 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news.

Their Five-Year Reinvested Value For Motorola Solutions. The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NYSE:MSI compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in MSI, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in MSI, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in MSI if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? Dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This is the date by which one must hold a share in order to receive the dividend. Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news. Index ETFs' Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to MSI's The plot above shows the evolution of MSI's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities).

After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $367.89. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-08-13 Strike Price: $365.00 Volume: 2044 Open Interest: 20488 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in SKYY, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in SKYY, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in SKYY if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? Dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This is the date by which one must hold a share in order to receive the dividend. Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. However, by the time the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag after the dividend rights have been rewarded. This uncertainty is simply due to broader market forces that exist on any day of trading. SKYY's Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to That Of Index ETFs The plot above shows the evolution of SKYY's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for SKYY, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. Finally -- what's the point of all this? The key insight to take from this article is to note how much value simply looking at the price chart of SKYY's common stock misses if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings.

Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news.

The stock price moved down to $365.2 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-13 Strike Price: $365.00 Volume: 3709 Open Interest: 3098 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 12:36:18 -0400",Five-Year Compounded Value of Ritchie Bros Auctioneers Holdings,"12:36 PM EDT, August 13, 2021 (Benzinga Newswire) The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Retained earnings is calculated as: RE = BP + Net Income - Dividends Where BP = Retained Earnings at the beginning of the period. Net Income = Revenue - Expenses Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NYSE:RBA compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in RBA, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in RBA, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in RBA if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. Dividend Mechanics A key thing to note is that dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This ex-date is the date on which one must be a holder of a share in order to receive the share's dividend. At the close of trading on that day, the effective value of each share may go down by the size of the dividend, because new purchasers will not hold the right to receive the dividend. However, by the time the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag after the dividend rights have been rewarded. This uncertainty is simply due to broader market forces that exist on any day of trading. Index ETFs' Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to RBA's The plot above shows the evolution of RBA's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for RBA, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. By looking at the price chart of RBA's common stock one can see that price appreciation alone misses a fair bit of value if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

Net Income = Revenue - Expenses Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NASDAQ:FELE compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in FELE, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in FELE, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in FELE if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? A key thing to note is that dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This ex-date is the date on which one must be a holder of a share in order to receive the share's dividend. At the close of trading on that day, the effective value of each share may go down by the size of the dividend, because new purchasers will not hold the right to receive the dividend. However, by the time the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag after the dividend rights have been rewarded. This uncertainty is simply due to broader market forces that exist on any day of trading. FELE's Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to That Of Index ETFs The plot above shows the evolution of FELE's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for FELE, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. Finally -- what's the point of all this? The key insight to take from this article is to note how much value simply looking at the price chart of FELE's common stock misses if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 12:33:04 -0400","Exponent, A Five-Year Analysis: How Important Is Re-Investing Dividends?","The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future earnings potential. One of the key ways that company earnings find their way into an investor's pocket is through dividends, which are cash or stock payments that represent a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Retained earnings is calculated as: RE = BP + Net Income - Dividends Where BP = Retained Earnings at the beginning of the period. Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NASDAQ:EXPO compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in EXPO, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in EXPO, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in EXPO if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. Dividend Mechanics A key thing to note is that dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This ex-date is the date on which one must be a holder of a share in order to receive the share's dividend. At the close of trading on that day, the effective value of each share may go down by the size of the dividend, because new purchasers will not hold the right to receive the dividend. However, by the time the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag after the dividend rights have been rewarded. This uncertainty is simply due to broader market forces that exist on any day of trading.

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $365.34. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-23 Strike Price: $367.00 Volume: 1147 Open Interest: 2878 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-23 Strike Price: $367.00 Volume: 1147 Open Interest: 2878 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 12:31:28 -0400",Why Worry With Dividends? Their Five-Year Reinvested Value For Primerica,"The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Retained earnings is calculated as: RE = BP + Net Income - Dividends Where BP = Retained Earnings at the beginning of the period. Net Income = Revenue - Expenses Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NYSE:PRI compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in PRI, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in PRI, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in PRI if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. Dividend Mechanics Dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This is the date by which one must hold a share in order to receive the dividend. Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. However, by the time the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag after the dividend rights have been rewarded. This uncertainty is simply due to broader market forces that exist on any day of trading. PRI's Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to That Of Index ETFs The plot above shows the evolution of PRI's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for PRI, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. Finally -- what's the point of all this? The key insight to take from this article is to note how much value simply looking at the price chart of PRI's common stock misses if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

They argue there are headwinds such as inflation. Some also suggest that considering the markets have moved higher, it is overdue for some profit-taking. Fortunately for investors, there are ways to hedge portfolios against a downturn. There are even ways to profit. This can be done with inverse ETFs. These ETFs are structured to move in the opposite direction of the markets. One of them is the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:SQQQ). This ETF uses leverage and is designed to move by a factor of three inversely to the NASDAQ 100 Index. For example, if the Index falls by 2%, SQQQ should rally by about 6%.","Why The SQQQ ETF Will Take Off If The Market Goes Lower.

"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 12:33:37 -0400",Why Worry With Dividends? Their Five-Year Reinvested Value For Dover,"The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future earnings potential. One of the key ways that company earnings find their way into an investor's pocket is through dividends, which are cash or stock payments that represent a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Retained earnings is calculated as: RE = BP + Net Income - Dividends Where BP = Retained Earnings at the beginning of the period. Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NYSE:DOV compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in DOV, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in DOV, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in DOV if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? Dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This is the date by which one must hold a share in order to receive the dividend. Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news. DOV's Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to That Of Index ETFs The plot above shows the evolution of DOV's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for DOV, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. Finally -- what's the point of all this? The key insight to take from this article is to note how much value simply looking at the price chart of DOV's common stock misses if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 11:04:44 -0400","Understanding Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1's Unusual Options Activity","Shares of Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $367.21. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-08-25 Strike Price: $360.00 Volume: 2048 Open Interest: 2795 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:31:26 -0400","Extra Space Storage, A Five-Year Analysis: How Important Is Re-Investing Dividends?","The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NYSE:EXR compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in EXR, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in EXR, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in EXR if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? Dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This is the date by which one must hold a share in order to receive the dividend. Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news. Index ETFs' Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to EXR's The plot above shows the evolution of EXR's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for EXR, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. By looking at the price chart of EXR's common stock one can see that price appreciation alone misses a fair bit of value if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

Dividend Mechanics Dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This is the date by which one must hold a share in order to receive the dividend. Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. However, by the time the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag after the dividend rights have been rewarded. This uncertainty is simply due to broader market forces that exist on any day of trading.

Dividend Mechanics A key thing to note is that dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This ex-date is the date on which one must be a holder of a share in order to receive the share's dividend. At the close of trading on that day, the effective value of each share may go down by the size of the dividend, because new purchasers will not hold the right to receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news. PKI's Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to That Of Index ETFs The plot above shows the evolution of PKI's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for PKI, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. Finally -- what's the point of all this?

Their Five-Year Reinvested Value For Allied Motion,"The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Retained earnings is calculated as: RE = BP + Net Income - Dividends Where BP = Retained Earnings at the beginning of the period. Net Income = Revenue - Expenses Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NASDAQ:AMOT compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in AMOT, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in AMOT, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in AMOT if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? A key thing to note is that dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This ex-date is the date on which one must be a holder of a share in order to receive the share's dividend. At the close of trading on that day, the effective value of each share may go down by the size of the dividend, because new purchasers will not hold the right to receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news. AMOT's Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to That Of Index ETFs The plot above shows the evolution of AMOT's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for AMOT, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. Finally -- what's the point of all this? The key insight to take from this article is to note how much value simply looking at the price chart of AMOT's common stock misses if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

Note, too, that the height of each bar for IUSG, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. Finally -- what's the point of all this? The key insight to take from this article is to note how much value simply looking at the price chart of IUSG's common stock misses if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

Compounding Returns In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Retained earnings is calculated as: RE = BP + Net Income - Dividends Where BP = Retained Earnings at the beginning of the period. Net Income = Revenue - Expenses Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NASDAQ:IUSG compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in IUSG, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in IUSG, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in IUSG if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? A key thing to note is that dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This ex-date is the date on which one must be a holder of a share in order to receive the share's dividend. At the close of trading on that day, the effective value of each share may go down by the size of the dividend, because new purchasers will not hold the right to receive the dividend. However, by the time the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag after the dividend rights have been rewarded. This uncertainty is simply due to broader market forces that exist on any day of trading.

"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 12:30:37 -0400",Five-Year Compounded Value of STMicroelectronics Holdings,"Compounding Returns In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NYSE:STM compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in STM, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in STM, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in STM if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. Dividend Mechanics A key thing to note is that dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This ex-date is the date on which one must be a holder of a share in order to receive the share's dividend. At the close of trading on that day, the effective value of each share may go down by the size of the dividend, because new purchasers will not hold the right to receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news. Index ETFs' Reinvested Dividend Value Compared to STM's The plot above shows the evolution of STM's reinvested dividends compared to those for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) ETFs (which track the components of the S&P 500, and NASDAQ 100, respectively, and pay out dividends for the underlying securities). Note that the bars could not be below zero, as a reinvested dividend represents a fraction of a share of a company, and those shares cannot go below zero. Note, too, that the height of each bar for STM, SPY, and QQQ represents the final difference between the green and red lines on graph number 1. By looking at the price chart of STM's common stock one can see that price appreciation alone misses a fair bit of value if one's considering holding the stock for a long period of time.

"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 13:08:21 -0400",Five-Year Compounded Value of HP Holdings,"The Power of the Dividend In a world obsessed with price movements of stocks, it's easy to lose sight of what those prices represent -- the value of holding a company's future profit potential. One of the key ways that profit potential turns into profit actualization in an investor's pocket is the dividend -- cash (usually) payments made to stockholders representing a portion of a company's retained earnings. Retained earnings is found under the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet and represents the amount of earnings a company has left over after paying dividends to its shareholders. Before further discussion of why dividends can be impactful in the long-term, here's a plot showing how much of a difference reinvested dividends would make in one's five year holdings of NYSE:HPQ compared to holding the dividends as cash and regular price appreciation. The following plot shows three values over a five-year period: 1) The value of a $100 investment in HPQ, with only price appreciation. 2) The value of a $100 investment in HPQ, without re-investment. 3) The value of a $100 investment in HPQ if dividends were immediately reinvested. 4) The value of a $100 investment in NASDAQ:SPY if dividends were immediately reinvested. How Does a Dividend Impact a Stock's Price? Dividends will be announced with an ex-date. This is the date by which one must hold a share in order to receive the dividend. Right when trading closes on that day, the market price of each share is expected to drop by the size of the dividend, because anyone now purchasing the stock will not receive the dividend. That said, once the market opens the next day, the stock price could rebound up beyond its previous close, or continue to lag behind its prior value. This uncertainty is simply due to general market forces that exist on any day of trading. For instance, the company's industry may be trading up due to some sort of positive news, completely offsetting buyers' lack of dividend rights...or, conversely, the company's industry may be trading down due to some sort of negative news.

Broad-Based Sell-Off Takes Hold: After starting the week on a weak note, stocks were seen extending their losses on Tuesday, led by the tech sector. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.18% at 14,643.26, underperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500 Index. The latter two gauges were down 1.01% at 34,518.61 and 1.54% lower at 4,374.69, respectively. Tuesday marks the third straight session of losses for the Nasdaq Composite Index, and the S&P 500 Index has been lower for a second straight session in running. The Dow Jones Industrial is seen snapping a four-session winning streak. Related Link: Why Apple Is A 'Top Tech Name' To Own Right Now Multiple Factors Work In Unison: The weakness in the market is orchestrated by a slew of negative catalysts. • Fears of imminent interest rate hikes have pushed bond yields to their highest level since late June. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is rising 3.841% to 1.5410. • The rise in bond yields is attributable to recent hawkish comments by Fed officials. In prepared remarks delivered to the Senate Banking Committee, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at higher inflation lasting longer than anticipated. • The U.S. dollar is also trading at its highest level in over 10 months amid fears of removal of monetary policy accommodation. The U.S. dollar was last seen up 0.44% at 93.80. • WTI crude oil prices, which touched a three-year high at $76.67 earlier in the day amid fears over a demand-supply imbalance, have pulled back and rea down 1.33% at $74.45. The retreat could be attributed to the dollar strength, as crude oil is dollar-denominated. FAANGs Take A Beating: Elite tech stocks, going by the moniker FAANG, are all notably lower. Higher bond yields make the returns on stocks less attractive, triggering liquidation in the latter asset. The primary target in such an equity sell-off would be tech stocks, which boast of heady valuations. Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) shares were down 3.93% at $339.70. Amazon.com, Inc.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is rising 3.841% to 1.5410. • The rise in bond yields is attributable to recent hawkish comments by Fed officials. In prepared remarks delivered to the Senate Banking Committee, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at higher inflation lasting longer than anticipated. • The U.S. dollar is also trading at its highest level in over 10 months amid fears of removal of monetary policy accommodation. The U.S. dollar was last seen up 0.44% at 93.80. • WTI crude oil prices, which touched a three-year high at $76.67 earlier in the day amid fears over a demand-supply imbalance, have pulled back and rea down 1.33% at $74.45. The retreat could be attributed to the dollar strength, as crude oil is dollar-denominated. FAANGs Take A Beating: Elite tech stocks, going by the moniker FAANG, are all notably lower. Higher bond yields make the returns on stocks less attractive, triggering liquidation in the latter asset. The primary target in such an equity sell-off would be tech stocks, which boast of heady valuations. Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) shares were down 3.93% at $339.70. Amazon.com, Inc.

"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 08:45:07 -0400","Here's How Much Investing $1,000 In The Invesco QQQ ETF One Year Ago Would Be Worth Today","Investors who have owned high-flying tech companies, economic reopening plays and “meme” stocks have made a killing in the market in the past year. But you didn’t have to be a stock-picking genius to generate some historically good returns since Nov. 10, 2020. Even investors who took a conservative, diversified approach to the market in the past year have made a tremendous return on their investment at this point. In 2019, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) generated an extremely strong 31.2% total return, but the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) topped it with a 38.9% total return. The QQQ ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Related Link: Here's How Much Investing $1,000 In Camber Energy Stock One Year Ago World Be Worth Today Pandemic Sell-Off: The QQQ fund started 2020 on a high note, rising from around $215 to start the year to a pre-pandemic high of $237.47 in mid-February. Unfortunately, over the next several weeks the bottom completely fell out of the market thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. The QQQ ETF plummeted as low as $165 on March 23, 2020, the same day the S&P 500 bottomed. At the time, investors had no idea March 23 would mark the end of the shortest bear market in U.S. history at just 33 days in duration. By April 7, the QQQ was back above $200. By June 4, the fund was back at new all-time highs, but the rally certainly didn’t stop there. The combination of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, unprecedented government stimulus measures, a virus mortality rate that was much better than initially feared and a handful of extremely effective vaccines sent growth stock prices skyrocketing well above pre-pandemic levels. Charging Into 2021: Two brief tech stock sell-offs in September and October of 2020 were mere bumps in the road for the QQQ in the march to all-time highs of $400.99 earlier this month. Unfortunately, concerns about inflation and Federal Reserve tapering in recent weeks have driven the QQQ fund back down to $393.82. Investors who bought the QQQ fund a year ago and held on to today have outperformed the total return of the SPY in that time, but only by a small margin. In fact, $1,000 in the QQQ ETF bought on Nov. 10, 2020, would be worth about $1,377 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, the fate of QQQ investors rests largely in the hands of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Together, those two tech behemoths represent a combined 21.2% of the QQQ’s total assets.","Here's How Much Investing $1,000 In The Invesco QQQ ETF One Year Ago Would Be Worth Today.

What Happened: The Nasdaq ETF QQQ is approaching the $400 strike, which is critical because it represents the zero gamma point for the ETF. The zero gamma point is where the estimated gamma of the market flips from positive to negative. Positive gamma is when the market is overall net long options, while negative gamma is when the market is net short options. Why This Matters: When the markets are in positive gamma (net long options), volatility tends to be lower and the option market makers tend to provide liquidity and stabilizing flows to the ETF. However, when the market is in negative gamma (net short options), volatility tends to increase with market makers taking liquidity and destabilizing the movements. Below is a graph of the S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) showing how the volatility changes between positive and negative gamma (image below, source: option metrics) When the market opened today, the Nasdaq QQQ ETF was in mildly positive gamma territory, with the estimated gamma exposure around $185 million (notional). Today's movements have been characteristic of that positive gamma environment, with volatility being low. What's Next: As long as the QQQ's can hold the $400 level on a daily closing basis, dips will likely be bought, but upside resistance should appear around the $408 and $410 strikes for the week. If, however, the QQQ's has a daily close below the $400 strike, this could increase volatility. Combine that with a solid option expiry to end the week, and next week could see an increase in volatility. For now, the index ETF looks supported while above the $400 strike, but it should be noted option traders are buying protection on the day with over 571,000 puts traded versus approximately 460,000 calls (image below).
